The most well-funded campaign for the empty rep seats comes from HC employees who have said that they are interested in \"doing their part\" for the community. It's unclear why these particular people have chosen to run, but it is clear that they enjoy support from their employer. The two HC employees have received funding for their campaigns and an unprecedented vacation in order to run.  </p>\n<p><strong>Wall Maintenance Failure Spreads</strong> | West Central Wall district, which now houses evacuees from WeSoWa along with its own residents, is seeing its own flooding as whatever phenomenon caused the wall to spring a leak in WeSoWa has spread to the central district, causing fear as it becomes unclear if WeCentWa faces its own evacuation order. </p>\n<p><figure class=\"figure\">\n<img src=\"https://i.giphy.com/media/p9o6H3ss2sgLu/giphy.gif\" alt=\"Protesters have been actively defacing walls with Vert-infused art\" />\n  <figcaption class=\"figcaption\">\n    <em>Protesters have been actively defacing walls with Vert-infused art.</em>\n  </figcaption>\n</figure></p>\n<p><strong>Pollution Scrubber Failure Kills Over a Dozen</strong> |&nbsp;East South Wall saw the neighborhood pollution scrubber fail in the late evening yesterday. The sudden influx of bad quality air, especially during the humid season, impacted hundreds of residents who suffered from choking and asthma attacks. East Hospital was overwhelmed by emergency crews who evacuated the worst impacted while repairs were underway. Before the scrubber could be turned on 15 were dead. </p>\n<p><strong>SoCentWa Troubles Earn Maintenance Attention</strong> | It is unclear if HC has stepped in, if The Enclave has diverted resources, or if SoCentWa has somehow fixed itself, but Flare events are down in the area and the network is stronger than it has been in weeks for the residents of SoCentWa, who remain in control of their central square after having faced down EPD and The Free Battalion.</p>\n<p><strong>Flares Continue to Plague Wall Districts</strong> | Flare events continue to spread to other Wall neighborhoods, with residents seeing network malfunctions and strange behavior from flatscreens across the lower levels of The Enclave. Our reporters have been investigating the phenomenon but other than badly impacting the ability of Wall-regions to sustain themselves and interfering with HC systems of all types it is unclear what is the cause or solution. HC continues to refuse to comment on the phenomenon of The Virtual leaking out of devices to project where it shouldn't. </p>"}
