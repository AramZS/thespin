Some believe this is a viral marketing campaign others suspect a new gang on the scene.</p>\n<p><strong>Drama on Thwip</strong> |&nbsp;The vainglorious stars of the Vert App Thwip gathered together two months ago to head to Thwip House, a rental supplied by app-maker Silverton. Despite being outside the walls in shitty drowntown Upland Cay the crew has got along well on drone delivered goodies (sponsor logos prominently shown) and endless production of the short Vert sims that make users sub. But yesterday Aiden \"ExtraA\" Logan fell into a hashtag coma… maybe. Thwip stars love their fast, often bad taste, \"pranks\". We'll believe it when we can poke him with our own fingers. </p>\n<p><strong>What mundane object will be a Pokémon next?!</strong> |&nbsp;After the record installs for Pokémon Wheelies, in which our favorite classic cars joined the ranks of 'inanimate objects transformed into cute creatures', you could be foregiven for thinking that there's no where left to go in the next Vert App in the series, but we've seen the announcement that a new sim is coming and that means there's yet more Pokémon to enter into our Pokédex.</p>\n<p><figure class=\"figure\">\n<img src=\"https://i.giphy.com/media/ZHq4tCdYtF0YM/giphy.gif\" alt=\"Also, will this finally be the end for whichever is your fav fighting animal?!\" />\n  <figcaption class=\"figcaption\">\n    <em>Also, will this finally be the end for whichever is your fav fighting animal?!</em>\n  </figcaption>\n</figure></p>\n<p><strong>\"Flare\" Up at South Central Wall</strong> |&nbsp;A</p>\n<p><strong>Continuing Vert Failures</strong> |&nbsp;A</p>"}
