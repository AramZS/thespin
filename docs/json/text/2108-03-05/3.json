Some believe this is a viral marketing campaign others suspect a new gang on the scene.</p>\n<p><strong>Drama on Thwip</strong> |&nbsp;The vainglorious quote unquote stars of the Vert App Thwip gathered together two months ago to head to a sponsored Thwip House,  a rental supplied by app-maker Silverton. Despite being outside the walls in Upland Cay, a shitshow town filled with rich people and a distinct lack of good food, the crew has got along well on drone delivered goodies (sponsor logos prominently shown) and an endless ability to produce the short Vert sims that users sub on to waste their lives one Thwip at a time. However, star of the collab Aiden \"ExtraA\" Logan has fallen into a hashtag comaâ€¦ maybe. Thwip stars have become infamous for fast, and often in bad taste, jokes and Logan's coma has drawn a wealth of extra simsubs to the Thwip House stream. We'll believe it when we can poke him with our own fingers. </p>\n<p><strong>What mundane object will be a Pokemon next?!</strong> |&nbsp;A</p>\n<p><figure class=\"figure\">\n<img src=\"https://i.giphy.com/media/ZHq4tCdYtF0YM/giphy.gif\" alt=\"Also, will this finally be the end for your fav fighting animal?!\" />\n  <figcaption class=\"figcaption\">\n    <em>Also, will this finally be the end for your fav fighting animal?!</em>\n  </figcaption>\n</figure></p>\n<p><strong>\"Flare\" Up at South Central Wall</strong> |&nbsp;A</p>\n<p><strong>Continuing Vert Failures</strong> |&nbsp;A</p>"}
