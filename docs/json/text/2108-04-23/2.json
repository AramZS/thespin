With no sense of irony the five billionaires running for president of the United States have taken a break from their tours of the 34 states and assorted floodplains to raise money for the public election fund, intended to support campaign activities by those unable to self-fund. </p>\n<p>No worries though, they're here to reach across the theoretical aisle that differentiates these megarich candidates for various parties in order to make sure your local rep can buy a Woogle ad. HC Ex-CFO Tuck Braedy, farmer-cum-governor Ralph White, gun philanthropist Lars Weyer, retired venture capitalist Lara Voier, and virt entertainer Austin Paulsen sold seats at staggering costs to their friends and wannabes and raised some enormous amount of money that is dwarfed by the income they earn off of regular banking interest. </p>\n<p>Press was, for some reason, not invited. </p>\n<p>However, leaked recordings show that the primary topic of discussion by the Rich and Richer was the current state of affairs at The Enclave. The malfunctions from The Wall and the various riots have them worried that someone might upset the current state of affairs and potentially topple them from the tippy top. Every candidate (who was worth more than a billion dollars) stood up and gave little speeches about how they would preserve the status quo and our sources assure us that the one thing they all agreed on was bringing down federal enforcement officers should chaos spread beyond The Enclave. HC CEO John Dyer was not in attendance. But when we asked his PR flacks for a comment, considering HC's personal investment in merc enforces in The Enclave, he declined to give one.  </p>\n<p>We gathered a number of on-the-ground reactions to the announcement that you can find in our Virtual Space. If you'd like to join them, we have the tools here!</p>\n<p>You should already have a profile registered with the authorities. Once that's done and you've got the initial work under the belt, you'll likely have to register your new higher level of experience! You'll have to register the new stats that come with joining our great adventure of reporting on morons every day for the next two years.</p>\n<p>Here's how it works:</p>\n<p><strong>Add +1 to a rating</strong> : You can mark permanent changes to a specific rating, though your profile should note a limit beyond which you can't go. Consider what each rating can do for your character and choose carefully. You can't go beyond your registered limit.</p>\n<p><strong>Take another Move from those available on your profile</strong> : Everyone's profile has a variety of moves you can make. If you're going up a level you can take one of the moves that you haven't already marked as having. </p>\n<p><strong>Take a Move from those available on another profile</strong> : All the profiles we've supplied show what they can do under the Moves section. You can learn something new and unusual though! If you do you can take a Move that describes your new skill from any of the other profiles below, just check their Full Descriptions to think about what you'd like to do.  </p>\n<p><strong>Gain an Ally/Gain a Team</strong> : You can gain some support staff that will be registered as working with you! You may already have some people you know that you're picking out, or just putting it out there that you're recruiting and getting some folks to show up. Allies and teams work similarly, they both are organized around a single motivation, even if a team comprises of 2 to 6 people. However, members of your team may have their own motivations outside of the team's requirements. </p>\n<p>The motivations you can register for your new Ally/Team:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Subordinate (motivation: to follow your exact instructions)</li>\n<li>Lieutenant (motivation: to execute the spirit of your\ninstructions)</li>\n<li>Friend (motivation: to provide emotional support)</li>\n<li>Bodyguard (motivation: to intercept danger)</li>\n<li>Confidante (motivation: to give you advice and perspective)</li>\n<li>Backup (motivation: to stand with you)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Ally/team members should have names registered along with\nwhat their background is too, how they look, and any special skills\nthey bring.</p>\n<p><strong>Register a Haven Feature</strong> : Have you got a serious home base to operate out from? Are you intending to improve it? Then you need to add that information to your profile! Select a new haven option from the list in the Expert profile.
