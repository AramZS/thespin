PR flacks tell us he is usually spending his days elbow deep in the work of keeping The Virtual up and running. However, he spoke up this week to support John Dyer, his ex-CFO, who is running as a presidential candidate for the Law and Order party.</p>\n<p>\"John is one of the best executives I've ever worked with and, as we all know, he has the corporate leadership skills that helped make HC one of the biggest companies in the world. His leadership of our charity fund also helped make The Enclave what it is today. Those are the skills we need in a leader.\"</p>\n<p>We gathered a number of on-the-ground reactions to the announcement that you can find in our Virtual Space. If you'd like to join them, we have the tools here! </p>\n<p>You should already have a profile registered with the authorities. Once that's done and you've got the initial work under the belt, you'll likely have to register your new higher level of experience! You'll have to register the new stats that come with joining our great adventure of reporting on morons every day for the next two years.</p>\n<p>Here's how it works:</p>\n<p><strong>Add +1 to a rating</strong> : You can mark permanent changes to a specific rating, though your profile should note a limit beyond which you can't go. Consider what each rating can do for your character and choose carefully. You can't go beyond your registered limit.</p>\n<p><strong>Take another Move from those available on your profile</strong> : Everyone's profile has a variety of moves you can make. If you're going up a level you can take one of the moves that you haven't already marked as having. </p>\n<p><strong>Take a Move from those available on another profile</strong> : All the profiles we've supplied show what they can do under the Moves section. You can learn something new and unusual though! If you do you can take a Move that describes your new skill from any of the other profiles below, just check their Full Descriptions to think about what you'd like to do.  </p>\n<p><strong>Gain an Ally/Gain a Team</strong> : You can gain some support staff that will be registered as working with you! You may already have some people you know that you're picking out, or just putting it out there that you're recruiting and getting some folks to show up. Allies and teams work similarly, they both are organized around a single motivation, even if a team comprises of 2 to 6 people. However, members of your team may have their own motivations outside of the team's requirements. </p>\n<p>The motivations you can register for your new Ally/Team:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Subordinate (motivation: to follow your exact instructions)</li>\n<li>Lieutenant (motivation: to execute the spirit of your\ninstructions)</li>\n<li>Friend (motivation: to provide emotional support)</li>\n<li>Bodyguard (motivation: to intercept danger)</li>\n<li>Confidante (motivation: to give you advice and perspective)</li>\n<li>Backup (motivation: to stand with you)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Ally/team members should have names registered along with\nwhat their background is too, how they look, and any special skills\nthey bring.</p>\n<p><strong>Register a Haven Feature</strong> : Have you got a serious home base to operate out from? Are you intending to improve it? Then you need to add that information to your profile! Select a new haven option from the list in the Expert profile. You have added this facility to your haven.</p>\n<p>Don’t bother trying to register a new feature if you don’t already have a haven! </p>"}
