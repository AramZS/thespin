When Congress passed the Superior Tools for Americans Beset by electoraL Emergency (STABLE) act in 2045 it had more unfortunote consiquences beyond making presidential terms a once-per-decade disaster. It also forced a lot more qualifications and certifications on anyone who wanted to be a journalist covering politics. But we're here to help you and our first batch of electoral correspondents! 

You should already have a profile registered with the authorities. Once that's done and you've got the inital work under the belt you'll need to level up your profile by registering the new stats that come with joining our great adventure of reporting on morons every day for the next two years. 

Here's what you can do:

**Add +1 to a rating**: You can mark permenant changes to a specific rating, though your profile should note a limit beyond which you can't go. Consider what each rating can do for your character and choose carefully. You can't go beyond your registered limit.

**Take another Move from those available on your profile**: Everyone's profile has a variaty of moves you can make. If you're going up a level you can take one of the moves that you haven't already marked as having. 

**Take a Move from those available on another profile**: All the profiles we've supplied show what they can do under the Moves section. You can learn something new and unusual  

**Gain an Ally/Gain a Team**: You can gain some support staff that will be registered as working with you! You may already have some people you know that you're picking out, or just putting it out there that you're recruiting and getting some folks to show up. Allies and teams work similarly, they both are organized around a single motivation, even if a team comprises of 2 to 6 people. However, members of your team may have their own motivations outside of the team's requirements. The motivations you can register for your new Ally/Team:

- Subordinate (motivation: to follow your exact instructions)
- Lieutenant (motivation: to execute the spirit of your
instructions)
- Friend (motivation: to provide emotional support)
- Bodyguard (motivation: to intercept danger)
- Confidante (motivation: to give you advice and perspective)
- Backup (motivation: to stand with you)

If the ally/team members don’t have names yet, pick them now. Decide
what their background is too, how they look, and any special skills
they bring.

**Register a Haven**: Have you got a serious home base to operate out from? Are you intending to improve it? Then you need to add that information to your profile! Select a new haven option from the list in the Expert profile. You have added this facility to your haven.

Don’t bother taking this improvement if you don’t have a haven!
