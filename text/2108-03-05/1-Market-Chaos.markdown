## ALF Face Off Against Cops

##### by Kat Lazaruzz

The Animal Liberation Front nearly took over the Corner Market last week when broad community concerns about how some of the shops were treating animals blew up into full blown conflict. 

Police were deployed to the Market and the adjacent Lower-3 core park in response to both the build up of ALF members and reports of supposed animal attacks, first in the park, then in the Market itself. Claire Guimara, EPD Sector Chief for the area, denied any animal abuses and refused to comment on the ALF presence.

"Corner Market allowed known abusers to continue to operate inside their building and that is gross behavior we will always work to end..." VM from Robin Harding, ALF member on site.

At the center of the conflict, the idea that a store owner was harming rare live animals. 

HC representatives were also on the scene, as they claimed the activity had damaged the nearby fiber tunnel that powers Virtual access for Lower-3. 

"While we're all happy to support animal welfare, the ALF apparently broke into the fiber storage and access system on some wild and unproven theory. As a result they may have damaged some of our equipment. We've not yet dismissed the question of legal action, something we need to consider when anyone enters our property illegally," said Official HC Spokesperson Cu Graves.

ALF denied the damage, attributing it to helpful bystanders who were forced to defend themselves against some sort of weapon created by alleged animal abuser and taxidermist Lawerence Beech.
