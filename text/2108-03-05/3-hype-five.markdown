**Grafitti hits both Vert and IRL** | The Enclave has been hit with a sudden explosition of graffiti tags on both physical objects and Vert storefronts, all are identical tags `YS/x` and while we can all agree that grafitti is pretty cool, they also seem to be accompanied by various break-ins or unlocking program failures. Some believe this is a viral marketing campaign others suspect a new gang on the scene.

**Drama on Thwip** | The vainglorious quote unquote stars of the Vert App Thwip gathered together two months ago to head to a sponsored Thwip House,  a rental supplied by app-maker Silverton. Despite being outside the walls in Upland Cay, a shitshow town filled with rich people and a distinct lack of good food, the crew has got along well on drone delivered goodies (sponsor logos prominently shown) and endless production of the short Vert sims that make users sub. But yesterday Aiden "ExtraA" Logan fell into a hashtag coma... maybe. Thwip stars have become infamous for fast, often in bad taste, jokes and Logan's coma has drawn a wealth of extra simsubs to the Thwip House stream. We'll believe it when we can poke him with our own fingers.
