**Grafitti hits both Vert and IRL** | The Enclave has been hit with a sudden explosition of graffiti tags on both physical objects and Vert storefronts, all are identical tags `YS/x` and while we can all agree that grafitti is pretty cool, they also seem to be accompanied by various break-ins or unlocking program failures.

However, it's only become harder with the rumored "Flares" arriving with high frequency at SoCentWa.

If this is some new HC stuntware it's going too far. 

**Continuing Vert Failures** | A
