# The Laborers' Union Pushes Candidates to Answer for Conditions

###### Tools for your Citizen Reporting Kit

headerEnd

FedSec has kept labor leaders away from candidate events as part of an unspecified security threat since the beginning of campaigning. However, labor protests have been springing up throughout the Flooded States and, with little individual power, more have been flowing into The Laborers' Union. With the spark of a rare major labor protest inside The Enclave's walls, TLU has used the attention to stage an empty-chair debate. 

With union officials accused of creating security risks throughout the campaign, no candidate would attend the event. So, standing up to empty chairs with static holos of each candidate in them, labor leaders and individual workers asked pointed questions around the possibility of reinstating minimum wage and giving additional powers and staff to the FTC, SEC and CFPB, all of which have basically become hollow shells over the past few decades. At the time of this printing, no answers from any candidate were forthcoming. 

As white collar journalists, our staff wasn't on stage, but we can still ask questions or talk to local organizers and workers! And so can you! We continually are looking for citizen and laborers who are willing to write on our pages and in our VR space.

If you'd like to contribute some questions and capture-data of the presidential candidates' terrible answers, we have the tools here!

You should already have a profile registered with the authorities. Once that's done and you've got the initial work under the belt, you'll likely have to register your new higher level of experience! You'll have to register the new stats that come with joining our great adventure of reporting on morons every day for the next two years.

Here's how it works:

**Add +1 to a rating** : You can mark permanent changes to a specific rating, though your profile should note a limit beyond which you can't go. Consider what each rating can do for your character and choose carefully. You can't go beyond your registered limit.

**Take another Move from those available on your profile** : Everyone's profile has a variety of moves you can make. If you're going up a level you can take one of the moves that you haven't already marked as having. 

**Take a Move from those available on another profile** : All the profiles we've supplied show what they can do under the Moves section. You can learn something new and unusual though! If you do you can take a Move that describes your new skill from any of the other profiles below, just check their Full Descriptions to think about what you'd like to do.  

**Gain an Ally/Gain a Team** : You can gain some support staff that will be registered as working with you! You may already have some people you know that you're picking out, or just putting it out there that you're recruiting and getting some folks to show up. Allies and teams work similarly, they both are organized around a single motivation, even if a team comprises of 2 to 6 people. However, members of your team may have their own motivations outside of the team's requirements. 

The motivations you can register for your new Ally/Team:

*   Subordinate (motivation: to follow your exact instructions)
*   Lieutenant (motivation: to execute the spirit of your
instructions)
*   Friend (motivation: to provide emotional support)
*   Bodyguard (motivation: to intercept danger)
*   Confidante (motivation: to give you advice and perspective)
*   Backup (motivation: to stand with you)

Ally/team members should have names registered along with
what their background is too, how they look, and any special skills
they bring.

**Register a Haven Feature** : Have you got a serious home base to operate out from? Are you intending to improve it? Then you need to add that information to your profile! Select a new haven option from the list in the Expert profile. You have added this facility to your haven.

Don’t bother trying to register a new feature if you don’t already have a haven!
