**Labor Levels are Low with Mids Workers Failing to Show** | Despite ever-growing positions at factories and offices on the borders of the Wall and the Mids fewer of these positions have been filled than ever before, according to last month's labor report. It is unclear if people are leaving the positions due to bad conditions, if travel restrictions have made getting to the metaphorical office to frustrating to continue or if there's another reason why. We're looking for further comment, ping us if you've recently quit.

**Western Flood Continues to Batter Citizens** | The flooding of the wall districts that started in SouthWesternWall has spread or eroded neighboring districts. Though it is an ever present threat to the citizens of The Wall, it has not yet effected any district above the edge of the Wall. HC has volunteered to pay for The Free Battalion to shore up at-risk districts, but this seems awfully self interested to us, as threatened wall districts now have volunteers from the Open Enclave Movement helping to repair floodgates and keep citizens dry. TFB and OEM have butted heads with conflicting missions, protesters trying to keep the Wall safe, with mercs simply trying to keep the water from overflowing into the Mids, and keeping the OEM quiet. 

**Skin Trade Takes on New Meaning as Wall Struggles to Adapt** | Grafting used to be an art, but amphibious vatskin grafts continue to become a necessity for citizens of The Wall. The growing movement to acquire these "skins" has meant a black trade in genevats and geneseeds to meet the demand. Further fueling the trade is a new class of scavangers and crooks preying on the displaced of the western Wall districts, diving into the flooded districts to either steal 

Graft artists have been increasingly popular since cheap wetware became available to anyone with the right licence and a cheap medtech bed. Most citizens focused on utility, with stylized grafts rare--especially in poorer areas of The Enclave. Stylized animal-skin grafts have become increasingly popular, topping orders throughout the Wall districts for the first time ever. Most seem to bee interested in amphibian vatskin, a shiny fashion graft that turns out to make living in damp and flooding areas of The Enclave a little easier.

**OEM Makes HC the Core of the Matter** | With almost every Wallward border closed, many of The Enclave's boroughs are in a tough situation when it comes to medical care. At one point every district was required to have its own city medical unit, but many have fallen into disrepair or shut down over the years and are reliant on cross-district ambulance and tube-sled travel to access emergency services. These transports are licenced to cross the closed borders, but the deployment of private security and chaos in some districts have made their jobs increasingly difficult. 

**Ratings for Upper Battle Rollas Lower Than Low** | Travel restrictions have split the Battle Rolla matches across the Wall line this season. Judging by VirtView ratings it seems few are interested in the Upper Rolla teams when they play each other. Rolla fans we interviewed cited a lack of conflict, energy and excitement in Uppers' matches. Meanwhile the Wallward matches have seen record engagement numbers.
