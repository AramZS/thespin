<em>Yesterday</em>

Elli Cordova: Quinn, I'm glad you're settling in, but please unsummon your Daemon Dogs when you leave. I sat down for lunch and and one ate a sandwich right out of my hand. It left behind a stream of zeros and ones that I had to scrub to get off. 

Adel Martinez: Can Daemon Dogs digest food? o.0

Quinn: Barky? I'd never unsummon Barky! 

Elli Cordova: Why not? You dismiss Daemon Dogs all the time.

Quinn: Barky is the first Daemon Dog I ever was able to get close to, and the first I hacked. I can't dismiss him! 

Quinn: The Daemon Dogs aren't really individual beings normally. They are sort of like a Class. You don't really call them, you instantiate them. Once you have a Daemon Dog instance it sticks around and gains knowledge but once you dismiss it you can't ever get that back. 

Quinn: You'll just get one new from the interversal archetype! The Barky who I met in the Riverwalk would be gone!  

Elli Cordova: ... ok. Well can you train him better?

Quinn: Did he eat your hand when he took the sandwich? 

Elli Cordova: I am pretty sure I would have mentioned that. 

Quinn: Well he's pretty well trained already then isn't he. :D

Elli Cordova: Quinn. Please. At least feed him better then? 

Quinn: I'll show you how to feed him

Quinn: Intentionally I mean 

<em>Today</em>

Aethelbert Butler: Have you seen Madra? She's been gone for longer than one of her usual trips. None of the teens seem to know where she is either. I guess it is possible they do know and won't tell me. 

Elli Cordova: We're really not going to be able to pretend we're not noticing her leaving if she keeps pushing it. 

Quinn: Doesn't this worry you? She's only a kid! 

<span class="scramble">Artria: <em>User Madra Meris has an active tracker. Her vitals are stable and there is no indicator of trouble.</em></span>

Adel Martinez: Tracker? 

Quinn: Tracker?

Quinn: Wait, can't you just tell us where she is Artri? 

<span class="scramble">Artria: <em>User Madra Meris has activated privacy mode. I cannot give more information.</em></span>

Quinn: 1+1+2+5+8=XClick for More...sa;l8sd9asdoifalk1856tjgs~gfhd!washr0

<span class="scramble">Artria: <em>That backdoor was removed 3.6 years ago.</em></span>

Elli Cordova: Quinn. You built a backdoor into the global chat system?

Quinn: Elli, don't be jealous that you didn't think of it first. :P

Adel Martinez: Sorry, but Artria, do you have trackers on all of us? 

<span class="scramble">Artria: <em>There is a tracker built into the standard software and hardware packages that reports to this subroutine, yes.</em></span>

Aethelbert Butler: I guess we must let her run free. She has been fine thus far. We'll know to get worried if something changes or she's gone for too much longer.

Adel Martinez: Are we all in Privacy Mode?

<span class="scramble">Artria: <em>That is not the default setting.</em></span>

Elli Cordova: Command:~ <span class="scramble">Privacy Mode Active for all in chat.</span>

<span class="scramble">Artria: <em>Privacy Mode Active for all participants.</em></span>

Adel Martinez: Thank you Elli. I'm not really sure I feel any better about the tracker though. :(

Quinn: Elli don't give Artri orders

<span class="scramble">Artria: <em>This subroutine exists to take orders. It is an expected communication mode.</em></span>

Quinn: It's still rude. 

Elli Cordova: There isn't really another option right now Quinn. Not until we find her missing piece. The part of her that is here. Just like Divi she's running a semi-autonomous program. You know that. 

Quinn: So what you're saying is you are rude to Divi too. 

Elli Cordova: It's just software. 

Quinn: There's a lot that's just software around the Enclave until it isn't. o.o

Elli Cordova: Do not give the robot an etheric soul 

Quinn: Do you know I haven't? That's my point! 

Aethelbert Butler: Could we empower Divi? 

Elli Cordova: Do not give the robot a soul or etheric powers. At least not until after we've figured out a way to stop the Enclave from falling into the sea. 

Quinn: <3 Fine Elli. You're no fun. :P
