A long avoided enemy has come out of the woodwork and is hunting for you. For years you'd outmaneuvered him and basically made it clear that he couldn't get at you without bringing way too much heat on to his head. If that's changing he must have made some powerful allies. Better dive into your underworld contacts and find out who he could have ended up with if you want to have a chance to stalemate him again.

Ask me one of these questions to find out what you learned from your contacts: 

- What is the state of the allegiances between the criminal underworld and the factions of law enforcement? 
- Have the criminal element started deploying the Weird and Verdant on a regular basis? 
- What has been the reaction to HC rolling out Free Battalion? 

You're continuing to experiment with the system HC build to pulled objects out of The Verdant, but you're finding yourself blocked off by the presence of your prisoners in the summoning circle:

- If you sneak over there and execute them without telling anyone you could get some real anti-magic armor together, but you'd have to hide it from the others. 
- You could acquire the skill to empower circles yourself by training in the Records Room, but it's unclear what that will unlock for you.
- You could change focus and get a mold together along with modifying Eric's old lab with a lightweight forge and have the capacity to start making some bullets with properties that make them stronger against specific monsters. 

Roll me a +Sharp to test your skills for one of these options: On a 8-12 pick one. On a miss you'll foul the magic involved.
