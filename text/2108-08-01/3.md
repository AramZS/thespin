**Oh'a No! |** Mob violence exploded all across the West City this week. Spiners have reported that our local mafiosi have come up against a foreign group which has fought with them in public and in shadows for over a year now, trying to wrest control of the city. Apparently a major victory has been gained by our local crew and they've taken the initiative. Fighting hasn't caused any stray casualties but it has become clearly public as it spreads out into the streets, with fighters pushing out from West Northern Wall.

Fighters from the local crew ganged together with The Laborers Union in East Northern Wall to fight ColSec, who wants to shut down the strike with no agreement with workers.

Power to the people seems to have benefited from a little mob armament in NoCentWa, where OEM has solidified a bunker against Free Battalion attempts to shut down the movement with violence.

The visiting mob has been pushed back, but it isn't dead yet. Strange rituals have been observed, with the participants almost always speaking Russian, all throughout the East Central and Southern Wall where confident young people and the occasional strange ganger has started to staff local shops and lean against walls with an eye towards the neighborhood tubes.

EPD has little to say about their conflict with either faction, but our sources quietly named the Vory as the Russian-speaking group that has apparently picked a losing fight with regular ganger groups.

**Sleepers Increase Again** | The rash of comas that afflicted the Enclave has begun again, as HCHealth Coalition has reported an upswing in the unknown affliction.

While cases had, in past years, been predominantly found in the Wall, no district seems safe from this outbreak, with reports scattered at ever level of the Enclave. HC commuters in the burbclaves that sit atop the wall edge all around the city seem to be badly hit.

It is unclear if the disappearances from these areas are kidnappings like in the case of Fivers, or comas away from home.

EPD struggles to catch up and register victims, relying on specialized HCHealth centers that have developed technology to safely store the sleepers.

Wall-based regions have had a particularly difficult time catching up with and tracking incidents, as many still are awash with refugees from flooded areas.

**Avengers or Gangers?** | Reports have piled up of a strange crew that has a tendency to pop out of nowhere, defend people against some particularly heavily modded gangers, then disappear again. These types of reports have been ongoing for a while, but a recent rush of them has arrived almost daily, with reports that this is a different, younger crew than has been seen before.

In South Eastern Wall the group fought a particularly toothy fellow who had been preying on local bodegas, was rewarded with free sandwiches, then dove back in to beat the daylights out of a TFB patrol group working as EPD support on HC's dime.

WeSoMids's Core Park has become a lake as flooding pushed up from the wall level, yet reports of the same group hoping from wave-peak to wave-peak to shut down some sort of extra-large squid were verified with three different witnesses.

Over near the edge of NoWest Mids the young fighters faced down a slobbering creep modded to look like a white ape. Then stuck around to fight back to back with mafia looking to take out an EPD precinct.

NoCaWall saw a ganger with a particularly froggy look wreck havok near their wall control nodes. A local TFB battalion was apparently too busy to stop the saboteur and OEM's attempt to repair the damage couldn't keep up... until the group's leader stepped out of an alley. Described by a Spiner as: "medium-height young woman, brown hair, wearing a high broad collared coat, metal spikes lining the top and the bottom of the firm stiff collar's sides with a path for a sturdy-looking rubber-looking band that secured what appeared to be three-decade old AR goggles to the back of her neck." The mystery women took down the ganger solo and asked some questions that were, apparently, personal.

**A Rush of New Arrivals**| Is it instability, opportunity, or just that strange feeling in the air? Long trains of boats have been coming to the Enclave this week, populated by new folk from all over the Sunken States. We welcomed em and did some interviews:

"Radiation out in the long deeps of the midwest has seeped into my bones. Some nights they glow right out of my skin. I go where the feeling quiets and it quiets here."

"I was king in the flatlands and tall walls of The Strip but when you're king it gets all too boring. I brought old Buddy here and figured I would work my way back to the top with a sweet song and a sharp blade, whichever works best."

"I Conducted the train here. Easy enough, so many of the big currents lead to the walls of the Enclave. Normally I'd just turn around with a full booking and take my float to the next destination, but I turned in my O.A.R. and stepped off the boat for the first time in years. Some times the water takes you to shore."

"No need for a Solar Tender in the Enclave, I suppose. Y'all got plenty of power here. But I spent a life in the mountains. My family been tenders since the flood, and our expanding clutch of solars has powered locals for generations. They helped us in return and respected us being lonesome, me and each sib taking a peak to our selves, apart-- but a part. I just saw the flooding here and realized, maybe there's something I could do."

**Stand Up**| The people of The Enclave have never felt trouble like they have this year and the result is a citizenry who are fighting back against the folks up top, trying to reclaim their power. The future is bright if we can make it so we have a voice that can't go unheard.

ColCorp's terrible conditions triggered a wildcat strike not too long ago and The Laborers Union has continued the fight since. Negotiations with ColCorp has been regularly interrupted by ColSec violence attempting to stop demonstrations and break up picket lines.

The Open Enclave Movement, or OEM, has maintained protests all across the Enclave, speaking up for rights, better treatment, a greater control of this city and The Virtual. They've recently unified around the story of Quinn, the engineer who was behind the invention of The Virt and had her work, money and story stolen by John Dyer. A protest line now surrounds the entry of the Lower Core of HC Peak, supported and joined by Jiri Orange, SoCentWa representative to the Borough Council. HC has yet to respond.

Even religion has fostered rebellion. We've written previously about the formation of a strange cult called Theta. But now they face protesters from their own ranks, who have pushed back against the power-hungry black-pill philosophy of the Thetas. They've set up a camp in The Floodzone, the lowest area of The Enclave, a place where only the lost would wander. There they've tried to build up and encourage a different way to live.

There are even rumors that the tight knit employees of HC have started to push back. Less and less of them show up every day as comas take down their co-workers and HC has not seen fit to cover the now alarming number of missing workers jobs, or help in their recovery. For the first time since its founding, rumbles and complaints have started to leak out of the company's walls.
