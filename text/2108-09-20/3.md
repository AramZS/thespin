### FLOOD FIVE

#### The five top stories we are keeping our heads above this week

headerEnd

**"DeadLights" Launch to Acclaim and Concern** | A new subbrand came out of HC last week, entirely expensive, luxury forward, but already with loud fans and critics across the feeds. The DeadLights pop-ups across the Enclave turn the megacorp's data-mining towards more personal endeavors, for the cred price of a medium-sized boat the new Virt VR rooms will sim a recreation of a loved one for three minutes. Influencer reports have noted the experience's accuracy and surprising humanity. Critics have noted how telling this is on the amount and depth of gulptech deployed to collect data across the virt and flatnet. Spin's editorial team polled the room and the general feeling is that it is a miracle of modern tech and a cold predatory perversion of our lives designed to paint a happy face on unacceptable business practices used for far worse purposes. 

**Don't Float On** | Detached docks below West Southern Mids have played host to an increasing number of Floats over the past week. Conductors were interviewed, refugee stories collected, and the floatilers shared some of their logs with The Spin. A number of our reporters collected data that seems to indicate a general rise in the water outside of the Sunken States and perhaps even in some outlying areas inside the upswell border tides. Community organizations have joined together, with OEM coordinating, to find living space and resources for incoming refugees from sunk areas. Templefolk have proven particularly helpful in marking out an ever increasing dry space in The Basement that can hold many people in temporary housing. 

This continues the pattern that began last month as more and more people come to The Enclave looking for a safe and dry home base. 


**TLU Wins Concessions From ColCorp, recognition from the Executive Council** | Strikers outside of ColCorp in the Wall and Mids areas of their GeneVat plant have won concessions from management. ColCorp has agreed to recognize them as a bargaining unit and begun negotiations with the guarantee that it will step back from the current 7 day work-week as the beginning point of a future contract. The other condition that CC has agreed to is to nominate a representative of The Labor Union to the Advisory Board of the Enclave Executive Council, where they will be able to more easily communicate with the C-Suites of all the city's megacorps as negotiations begin with other units. 

Reportedly, recognition to the EEC for TLU was nearly blocked by HC's own John Dyer, but he was outmanovered by savvy work from TLU organizers, who noted their next bid for unit recognition has come from HC's ranks of virt engineers. The rest of the EEC is, as always, more than happy to stab HC in the back in hope of negating some of its ultra dominance of Enclave markets. 

Klavdii Zayt, lead of the ColCorp unit, was elected by TLU to be their representative to the EEC.

**ColCorp Spice Rack Spilled** | The ColCorp 17-secret-spice recipe that has been one of the keys to their dominance of the printed food market has long been a closely guarded secret. Spices were not even printed simultaneously or in a single site to assure no individual could possibly reverse engineer the recipe. However, a hacker has liberated the recipe and, after a scavenger hunt that sent participants all over the Enclave resulted in a fully assembled recipe, wrasslin fanclub the Luchadorables has published the full file to the Virt. Rumor has it that ColCorp CEO and founder, The Colonel has quietly put out one of the Enclave's largest bounties for the booster. He may not be able to keep it up for long though, ColCorp stock halved yesterday night in after-hours trading on the city market. While it is slowly rising, it seems unlikely to return to its previous status for a long time. 

**"Doctor" Nagor issues Challenge** | Quack self-help "doctor" Aul Nagor was out-argued, out-maneuvered, and shamed on his own show. Funding, which had been rumored to have been coming primarily from fan of the show John Dyer, quickly dried up. Nagor has pivoted the way of many a scummy influencer before him and started on a career as a wrestler, declaring his intent to take down the guest who punctured his reputation.
