# Shadow B Corp "M" Funds New Informational Campaign 

###### Citizen Reporters May Find Helpful New Tools, Spin-Vetted

headerEnd

MCorp has been making quite an impression in the media landscape as we lead up to the election. Its funding has supported more than two dozen grants from Independent Enclave Screamsheets. Now, the corporation has funded a number of amplification campaigns to get this data out as well as slickly produced virt data-jackets that allow for virtuals to separate facts from fictions. While MCorp's leadership is carefully hidden behind a number of corpo privacy measures, employees involved in this effort have been discussing the positives in public--along with their surprisingly good pay. 

The Spin has vetted everything MCorp has produced thus far and it all looks clean and factually correct. At this point we recommend using their tools and resources as part of a mix of inputs to understand the upcoming election choice.

You should already have a profile registered with the authorities as a citjourn. Once that's done and you've got the initial work under the belt, you'll likely have to register your new higher level of experience! You'll have to register the new stats that come with joining our great adventure of reporting on morons every day for the next two years.

Here's how it works:

**Add +1 to a rating** : You can mark permanent changes to a specific rating, though your profile should note a limit beyond which you can't go. Consider what each rating can do for your character and choose carefully. You can't go beyond your registered limit.

**Take another Move from those available on your profile** : Everyone's profile has a variety of moves you can make. If you're going up a level you can take one of the moves that you haven't already marked as having. 

**Take a Move from those available on another profile** : All the profiles we've supplied show what they can do under the Moves section. You can learn something new and unusual though! If you do you can take a Move that describes your new skill from any of the other profiles below, just check their Full Descriptions to think about what you'd like to do.  

**Gain an Ally/Gain a Team** : You can gain some support staff that will be registered as working with you! You may already have some people you know that you're picking out, or just putting it out there that you're recruiting and getting some folks to show up. Allies and teams work similarly, they both are organized around a single motivation, even if a team comprises of 2 to 6 people. However, members of your team may have their own motivations outside of the team's requirements. 

The motivations you can register for your new Ally/Team:

*   Subordinate (motivation: to follow your exact instructions)
*   Lieutenant (motivation: to execute the spirit of your
instructions)
*   Friend (motivation: to provide emotional support)
*   Bodyguard (motivation: to intercept danger)
*   Confidante (motivation: to give you advice and perspective)
*   Backup (motivation: to stand with you)

Ally/team members should have names registered along with
what their background is too, how they look, and any special skills
they bring.

**Register a Haven Feature** : Have you got a serious home base to operate out from? Are you intending to improve it? Then you need to add that information to your profile! Select a new haven option from the list in the Expert profile. You have added this facility to your haven.

Don’t bother trying to register a new feature if you don’t already have a haven!
