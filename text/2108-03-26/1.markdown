## SoCentWa Explodes With HC Mercs and Flares

##### by Wrad Marge

Protesters in the South Central Wall district found themselves accosted by EPD and HC-bully-boys The Free Battalion today with little recourse but to fight back. They did so among an increase in strange happenings, weird Vert-ware, broken VSpaces and an increase in unexplained phenomenon.  

Flares in SoCentWa; general negligence from The Enclave's maintenance teams and borough council; and a failure to tick more than a dozen requests off the HC Support Queue last month; have left SoCentWa residents unable to regularly access The Virt and therefore often without access to essential daily provisions. It seemed like there would be some surcease when HC claimed to have back-traced the Virt problems to Farrah Price, but this hasn't resulted in any changes to service for the area. 

The protest in the district's central square encompassed days of speeches and outcry, as organizer Lacey O'Ryan brought in community leaders and political allies to defend SoCentWa's right to better support from both HC and The Enclave.

"The Enclave Central Council seems to think the best solution is to raise the tolls and lock dissatisfaction into a single district, but that won't work. Either they address it or it will spread." - Jiri Orange, SoCentWa representative to the Borough Council

Citizen Angivin Ward died in the first push of protesters out of the square. He led the first attempt to access the maintenance shafts that would allow SoCentWa residents to escape their borough. After that local Rolla team RyotGuurls joined the protesters in a big push towards the exit to the area, with casualties on both sides. However, the heavily armed and armored Free Battalion unfairly outbalanced the protesters and managed to stop anyone from escaping. 

While a number of Free Battalion mercs died in the lead up to the conflict, injuries and deaths were far more significant among the protesters, including the death of beloved Rolla captain Sasha Shovegood. 

Also of note, unusual activity and general freaky shit was recoreded across the district. Check our Vert site for embeds into events that could not be explained but that we caught on record.
