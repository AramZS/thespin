Your Weird nature has only been getting Weirder as of late and when you returned to the moonbase after the latest trip you realized you only narrowly avoiding falling on some hot sauce in the diner encounter with the Free Battalion. To keep you monster side under control you had to spend some time meditating and desperately not thinking about eating anyone's blood. On the flip side this has gotten you more in contact with your inner Weird, allowing you to focus yourself on some questions about the nature of The Verdent and etheric power. Ask me one of the following questions to get a feeling from your inner drives:

- Is there a way to use my incorporeal ability more effectively? 
- What can I do about the etheric spirit of Cor Larana that I've trapped in the Summoning Circle Lab?
- Since you returned to the moonbase something is pulling at you, what is it? 

Your connection with the etheric nature of The Verdent has only increased over time and use. Visions and drives are now hitting you with some real regularity. Here are some of the things you could See:

- The special weakness of your next big enemy
- The traitor who serves The Mother of Daemons (though not why)
- The weapon that will give you an advantage over The Mother of Daemons

Roll me a +Weird to focus your visions, you'll count them as free held questions on Investigate the Mystery to be used at any point in the adventure. On a 10+ select two things to come into focus. On a 7-9 pick one thing. On a failure you'll see magical consequences appear during the upcoming adventure.
