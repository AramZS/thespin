The latest upload has gotten your Luchadorables in a frenzy and your following is larger than ever! They're also excited that you're collaborating with KF Cindy, who--remember--you had previously gotten in a fight with but she proved she was on your side. You've been in the chat getting them excited and promoting yourself, along with the movement for SoCentWa. They're also a valuable source of information and the chat is a way for contacts to get in touch with you or the group. Ask me one of the following questions to get tips from your stream chat:

- What weirdness has been especially prevalent around The Virtual and where? 
- What is the deal between HC and the Free Battalion? 
- Had anyone met The Oracle of Clocks, where, when and in what context? 

You've charmed more than your fair share of folks in the encounters you've been having and some of them are trying to keep in touch via stream chat. Here are some of the past contacts you might find talking with useful:

- Claire Guimaras, Lower-1st Sector EPD Chief, was pretty disappointed in your group after your last encounter, but you saw that she followed you before that. You could reach out and stabalize that relationship and perhaps get some tips about what's going on in The Enclave. 
- Harvey Noble, Roboticist, became a huge fan of yours after your charming approach in the marketplace and has left endless supportive messages on all of your old and new Virt Clips. You could reach out to him and get some tips about how to work with and potentially improve the responses of the robots on the moonbase.
- Elli Cordova is not so much in your chat, but walking around the moonbase, perhaps you could apply some of your legendary charm to her to get a little more information about why she's so determined to find Antiom Quinn and what the two of them were working on. 

Roll me a +Charm to reach out to your fans (current and future) and find out some vital information. On a 11+ you can speak to two of them. On a 7-10 you'll be able to talk only one of them and on a failure you can choose to either permanently offend one person in exchange for being able to get information from another or not be able to get in contact with any of them.
