You've been getting better at ferreting out and getting a sense of The Weird that surround you now. Who knew that's where your life was going? When you returned to the moonbase you realized that, as it is with crime, being prepared means knowing the lay of the land. The Records Room and its AI are now open to your perusal. All the knowledge that HC has collected in its interactions with The Verdent up until the moonbase was abandoned 10 years ago is now at your fingertips. It's Research Time! You've been keeping a sharp eye on the events you've been pulled into and you've got some questions you want answered. 

Ask me one of these questions to find out what you learned in your research: 

- Why did the Daemons come into play, seemingly on their own, when they first killed The Oracle of Clocks and again when containment started breaking down around entity storage?
- What sort of things can happen in the case of possessions from The Verdent? 
- What did the increase in Flares mean in SoCentWa? 

You're also pretty interested in the idea that objects could be pulled out of The Verdent and HC has done quite a bit of research on this and has it in The Records Room. Here are some things the group has expressed an interest in that you might look into:

- A spell that will let you determine what Daemons are weak against in The Verdent and how to apply it to one of the group's weapons. 
- A talisman that HC might have on the base that gives +1 etheric armor 
- A set of useful instructions for the Summoning Circle Lab

Roll me a +Sharp to delve into the records and the base for these items: On a 10+ pick two, on a 7-9 pick one. On a miss your thievery will trigger countermeasures and you can choose to get out without an item by the skin of your teeth or to grab an item but suffer consequences in the process.
