**Vert on the flik...** | The Virtual has been having problems again. Somehow, despite living in the deep shadow of the tech overlords in HC--which invented the damn thing--we've had to boot up our flatsite because the connection remains unreliable all over town. Our ability to access that wonderful realm was stable almost entirely over the last decade, except for that still unexplained blip last year, but now it's about as dependable as THE SPIN Staff's job prospects, which is to say: *NOT AT ALL*.

**An all new thrillogy** | The Secret Overlords of the Disney bunker that survived California falling into the sea have mass-commed an ad campaign straight to every billboard, webwall and car-side in the Enclave Upper City. Who even wants this anymore? How do the Secret Overlords keep getting food? Is this what they unfroze Walt's head for? More on the latest from the lame kingdom as soon as we re-tune our illegal ad-blocking infection.

**Spirits in the Wires** | When The Virtual isn't down, we've been hearing endless reports around The Enclave of what people are calling "flares", things from The Virtual showing up in real life, or ad-vatars walking briefly out of webwalls to wave hello and perform impossible tricks. Normally we'd assume you're all drunk, but perhaps there's some Hot New Tech they're testing to surprise us all.

**Don't fill your step-ins** | Lords of Excrement are back in town. They're taking over The Enclave one bar at a time, and if it's anything like their usual tours we're sure the 3D printers will be running overtime on chair replacements, countertops, and fake teeth once they're gone. Don't forget to pre-order your liquor from the next ship in because there is sure to be a shortage by the end of the month. We'll post the schedule soon as they sober up.

**We thought the squirrels were bad before...** | In a new low for The Pigs, EPD identified a death in Lower-3's core park as a squirrel attack. We know cops don't care about anything under Lower-1 unless the floods rise, but blaming a clear homicide on attack-by-marmot is just disgraceful. We'd send a reporter to check but they won't let us in without the requisite firearm.
