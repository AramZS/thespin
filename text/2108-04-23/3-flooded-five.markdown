### FLOOD FIVE

#### The five top stories we are keeping our heads above this week

**BlubBlubGlubBlub** | A new way of living is emerging in the last unflooded sublevels of WeSoWa. Residents in sub7-9 have found themselves with no access to cross-sublevel buildings that were once a part of every day life. The core park is, of course, unaccessible. Options for entertainment and interaction seem few and far between. However, The Enclave's citizens are a hardy bunch and while the water is unsafe for swimming, boating has become a frequent past time and even a necessity for those looking to visit their neighbors. Boat-based social events and concerts are now a mainstay for WeSoWa.

**Virt Streaming Star Takes a Stand** | VirtLucho has been one of the more low-key of the sports to find streams and viewers in The Virtual. We, personally, prefer The Real for our headbashing. However, one of the Lucho streamers has been taking some wild journeys into the gamespaces and The Real as of late. While we're not sure which is which in his streams, what has been clear is his highlighting of poor conditions for refugees in the Wallward regions. While we're not sure anyone who was on Twhip House can rise above the Z-list, this is the best way anyone could. El Hombre Magnifico has been streaming irregularly but his conversations with Wall residents have been some of the best things to escape comms lockdown. 

**EastNoWa Port Sees Industrial Meet Desperate** | EastNoWa had one of the transit stations least used by citizens of The Enclave before the lockdown. Instead, it was the largest industrial port for transit from EastNoWa and NoEastWa, which contained some of The Enclave's largest factories and its food processing district. Now spicy vat chicken and terrible poverty sit side by side in the transit tubes, with the chicken usually getting priority. EPD and The Free Battalion continue to run security in the transit hub, but they are joined by ColSec the private security arm of ColFoods. ColSec reacts to theft of food and cutting in line for a transit tube with equal measure, and that measure is overwhelming fatal force.

**VibeTown Explodes off of Theater Scene** | The Mid Core has been the happy home of the theater district since the walls went up. Rarely has there been more excitement there than a heard of fans trampling someone for an autograph. However, flames crisped the neon lights and ancient CRTs of the Jacklin Theater last week when improperly stored throwbacktech used in the nostalgic play VibeTown came into contact with its store of hydrogen peroxide (used for its now famous glow stick dance number). VibeTown is currently closed seeking funding for repairs and scouring the Virt auctions for a new supply of shake weights. It is believed that a Flare incident may have been involved, but officials all deny that. 

**Battle Rolla Split by ICE and EPD** | Battle Rolla is one of the few times all districts of the Enclave upper to lower come together to beat each other senseless but with the new security measures at the Wallward borders we are seeing two parallel tournaments, as Mid and Upper teams compete amongst themselves while the stars of the Wall are fighting it out for top ranking.
