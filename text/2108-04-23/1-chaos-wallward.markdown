## WestWallward Police Step Back, Water and Gangs Flood Forward

##### by Kat Lazaruzz

headerEnd

Refugees and water flooded WestWall over the past two weeks. Somehow the Wall in WeCentWa, after threatening to leak flood water and ocean into the residences, has been stabalized. WeCentWa is now the primary location for refugees from the flooding, who have not been allowed to move upcity as the travel lockdown continues. The chaos has also benefited crime in the WestWall, with gangs stepping into more prominent and public roles in the communities. 

Our correspondents in the region report that Enclave PD evacuated WeSoWa sub0 through 6, with a mere 3 levels remaining safe for habitation, and most of those increasingly unaccessible. EPD established refugee camps of WeCentWa subs 1, 3 and 5. However, in the past week law enforcement seems to have abandoned the area, leaving very few officers in place. The consequences may include destruction in WeCentWa's well-known sculpture-focused core park.

The Enclave Council has continued to cut off regular travel cut between the Wallward communities and the Mids (much less the Uppers) which means resources have become sparse where they are needed worst. 

Gangs, most prominently the Russian-transplanted Vory V Zakone and the native sons of the Cosa Nostra, have stepped into place across WeWa, providing protection, smuggled resources, and basic necessities at a markup, but thus far with no pushback by relieved citizens or the apparently well-compensated cops.

"We believe that tampering and hacking in the lower levels of the city are causing the instabilities there and we must put hard Intrusion Countermeasure Electronics into place at the physical and virtual borders of the Wallward regions in order to secure the stability of the entire Enclave." - HC Spokesperson Cu Graves

HC takes credit for the Wall's safe-state with a software patch to the wall's regulation and processing systems, but if that was true, why do they remain unable to stop the water rising in WeSoWa? For whatever reason the wall and the other Virt-based systems seem to have stabilized in WeCentWa, providing some small relief to residents. But communications have been limited to keep all but the most basic text comms internal to the Wall levels. 

HC has justified their blocking off of the major Virt pipes by claiming that the Wall regions are responsible for their own chaos, system instability and disorder. They continue to deploy the mercenary corp "The Free Battalion" to secure major transit and comms points at the border. The result has been that many basic functions of life, access to resources, jobs, major banking systems, have been cut off. 

Meanwhile, many of the refugees in WestCentralWall struggle to even cross the Core where, for the desperate, the last remaining transit station open between the Wall and the Mids remains heavily guarded in EastNoWa.
