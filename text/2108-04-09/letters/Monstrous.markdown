The newly stabilized Moonbase is just teaming with Weird and it calls out to you so strongly you find yourself roaming the halls at night, your stomach roiling, just filled with the desire to eat something truly strange. If you let the Weird call to you then you may find yourself pulled in the direction of something useful, if only you could focus on it:

- A useful prompt for the possessed AI in the records room.
- A map of The Enclave in the control room.
- Entity Control's various hook ups to The Verd

Select one and find out more information about how it impacts your future

The more you use your powers the more effective they get and you have begun to feel a strange affinity with your fellow Hunters as your Weird and theirs' interact:

- The Luchador
- The Crooked
