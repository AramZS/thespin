The latest upload has gotten your Luchadorables in a frenzy and your following is larger than ever! They're also excited that you're collaborating with KF Cindy, who--remember--you had previously gotten in a fight with but she proved she was on your side. You've been in the chat getting them excited and promoting yourself, along with the movement for SoCentWa. They're also a valuable source of information and the chat is a way for contacts to get in touch with you or the group. Ask me one of the following questions to get tips from your stream chat:

- What is the community with the worst Flare situation?
- Has anyone spotted Daemons entering their Virtual spaces and where?
- Had anyone met The Oracle of Clocks, where, when and in what context? 

You've charmed more than your fair share of folks in the encounters you've been having and some of them are trying to keep in touch via stream chat. Here are some of the past contacts you might find talking with useful:

- Boytoy George suffered some bad damage in your encounter with him, but it turns out he has survived and continues to take a major part in the SoCentWa protests. He doesn't remember much about what happened, perhaps you can talk him into an ally by telling him a version of the story that makes you look favorable. He might give you a more in depth update on SoCentWa in return.
- Earendil, when you last left him, was trying to put his border town back together and figure out where his people went. He reached out and left his contact info. You might be able to get more information and some direction about places to further investigate. 
- Wrad Marge, after her encounter with you, has been looking deeper into magic and continually emailing you little things she's found asking for a comment. You might be able to trade some answers to her in exchange for some ideas for further investigation into The Verdant. 

Roll me a +Charm to reach out to your fans (current and future) and find out some vital information. On a 11+ you can speak to two of them. On a 7-10 you'll be able to talk only one of them and on a failure you can choose to either permanently offend one person in exchange for being able to get information from another or not be able to get in contact with any of them.
