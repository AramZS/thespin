**Core Rep Race Sweeped by HC Favs** | Ex-HC employees funded heavily by individual and corporate contributions from inside HC swept the emergency elections set up to fill core seats emptied by a successful corruption prosecution. It will likely give HC an outsized influence on the districts its HQ resides in without any illegal bribes necessary. Is that irony? We're pretty sure we're too ill to tell. 

**Mids Citizens Don't Hide Their Ugly Classism** | With the dire straits in some of the wall regions on full display over the last week, the Midsclass took the opportunity to show that empathy isn't in their dictionary.
