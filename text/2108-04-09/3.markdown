### FIVE FOR THE FENCES

#### These five stories are driving us wild

**Core Rep Race Sweeped by HC Favs** | Ex-HC employees funded heavily by individual and corporate contributions from inside HC swept the emergency elections set up to fill core seats emptied by a successful corruption prosecution. It will likely give HC an outsized influence on the districts its HQ resides in without any illegal bribes necessary. Is that irony? We're pretty sure we're too ill to tell.

We've called on leadership to allot emergency funds and staff to bolster the repair queue. 

**Remix Release Crosses LoE with BonAI** | We've always preferred a good broken limb or three from in-person participation at Lords of Excrement concerts, and it is a great way to cull a city's excess bars with flames and massive insurance claims. However, we're enjoying the Brown Album release, which takes lofi musician robot BonA
