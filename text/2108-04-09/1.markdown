## WeCentWa on Lockdown After Transit Hub Policing Failed to Stop Deaths

Limited transit between WeCentWa and the rest of WestWall to the Mids and Uppers has been shut down by Enclave officials after a series of attacks on the main up-down station and at the off-load station to the mids resulted in nearly a dozen deaths and a brief spread in Vert malfunctions out of the Wall regions and into WeCentMid.

The evacuees seem to have brought the disruptions to Virtual connections with them to WeCentWa, though no authority can say how that could be possible.

The stress of the situation was componded even further on residents when the wall in this region started to malfunction as well, letting some floodwater seep where it shouldn't. As a result, an unprecedented rush for uptransit had been ongoing for days.
