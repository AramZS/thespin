## Wildcat Strike Leaves Chicken Raw

##### by Alden Cordell

headerEnd

Omnibus blue-collar worker group The Laborers' Union broke out in an unannounced and seemingly unplanned strike due to long hours and increasingly difficult to manage security conditions at the primary ColFoods genevat-chicken plant in East Northern Wall. 

The Laborers' Union includes genevat workers and growth supervisors on the factory floor of ColFood's largest Enclave plant. Apparently an unknown organizer spread word of issues and concerns about quality of life issues in the plant via a pamphleting campaign and ColSec was badly positioned and could not intercede before the strike became public knowledge in the overcrowded district. ETAC forces were also apparently out of position at the various borders to EastNoWa, which has been under overall travel restriction since EPD forbade Wall districts' residents from up-city travel. Other Laborers' Union chapters traveled from districts throughout The Enclave over the course of the day and the strike ended up merging with the protest against travel restrictions that has been active in EastNoWa for a week. The resulting activity spread to most of EastNoWa's common spaces.  

EPD and ETAC both deny it, but our reporters' sensorpacks detected an EMP in the afternoon that was likely the reason ColSec and ETAC were so disorganized at the exit

Our datacache is brief, but clear. For any doubters we have made it available in our Virt space, appropriately stripped of any identifiers that could be used to trace it back to the people who ferried it out of HC systems.

HC has refused to give The Spin any additional information about Quinn and her role in the early Virt, simply sating that she no longer works there. Our data makes it clear that she once did, and what happened after? The datacache includes an argument about some functionality of the Virt and how it handles wireless power transmission, a major important aspect of its success. Was there a falling out between Quinn and the company she might have made great? If so, what occurred after? 

We interviewed some previous HC employees about their rarity and the difficulty of departing the world's most wealthy and secretive company.
