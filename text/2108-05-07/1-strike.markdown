## Wildcat Strike Leaves Chicken Raw

##### by Alden Cordell

headerEnd

Omnibus blue-collar worker group The Laborers' Union broke out in an unannounced and seemingly unplanned strike due to long hours and increasingly difficult to manage security conditions at the primary ColFoods genevat-chicken plant in East Northern Wall. 

The Laborers' Union includes genevat workers and growth supervisors on the factory floor of ColFood's largest Enclave plant. Apparently an unknown organizer spread word of issues and concerns about quality of life issues in the plant via a pamphleting campaign and ColSec was badly positioned and could not intercede before the strike became public knowledge in the overcrowded district. ETAC forces were also apparently out of position at the various borders to EastNoWa, which has been under overall travel restriction since EPD forbade Wall districts' residents from up-city travel. Other Laborers' Union chapters traveled from districts throughout The Enclave over the course of the day and the strike ended up merging with the protest against travel restrictions that has been active in EastNoWa for a week. The resulting activity spread to most of EastNoWa's common spaces.  

EPD and ETAC both deny it, but our reporters' sensorpacks detected an EMP in the afternoon that was likely the reason ColSec and ETAC were so disorganized at the up-tube station near the ColFoods plant. If an EMP did occur, no group has taken credit for the event.

The Borough Council has yet to give a date for when the travel restrictions will end, even with protests around these restrictions growing throughout the city. Compounding citizens' concerns, Wall districts have become increasingly overloaded with people as some districts close, due to the flooding that has become endemic over the last month, and the water forces residents into neighboring districts ill-resourced to help them.

ColCorp and its subsidiaries ColFoods and ColSec were asked for comment on the strike and the claim of bad conditions, bad hours and overwork in ColFoods' EastNoWa factory. They have yet to give a comment.

We interviewed labor leaders and protesters for an audio/video interactive about the week EastNoWa become the center of protests in the Wall districts.
