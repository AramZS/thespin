Guimaras leads the Enclave Police Department in the Lower 1st, a sector that includes The Corner Marketplace and a portion of SoCentWa including the area's Core Park. 

You encountered her during Case 0, Case 4 and Case 6. In each incident she found that you helped her a great deal and were amenable to disccusion. She's welcomed your input and, from her perspective at least, you've helped her with some rather difficult incidents. 

She isn't clued in to The Verdent, but she is aware that something strange is happening around The Enclave and your little group appears to be experts. As a result she may call you in when the going gets weird, as she did during the post-Keyfall incident in Case 4.
