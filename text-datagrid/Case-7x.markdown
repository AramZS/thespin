#### Prologue

Letters:

__The Crooked asked:__ What is the state of the allegiances between the criminal underworld and the factions of law enforcement? 

Some factions of the EPD have been receiving significant bribes, some believe laundered from HC, to ignore reports of a particular nature (the weird). A faction of criminals have begun to nose into these payments and been using them to get in with bribe-ready or blackmail-able cops. The cops have, as a result, basically been providing hints about where incidents have occurred and left criminals to do clean up. A Russian import, the Vory V Zakone have used to opportunity to both expanded their protection business and put quite a few cops in their pockets.

It is believed that the alliances between the Vory and the EPD in the wake of these bribes has changed the power structure, moving from a smaller group led by a Vory (a criminal who climbed the ranks) to a Avtoritet (a government official of some sort who runs things from a distance)

Notably a less organized grouping of criminals has connected these incidents with people falling into comas and taken the opportunity to rob them.

__The Luchador asked:__ Had anyone met The Oracle of Clocks, where, when and in what context? 

No one has seen the avatar you described recently, but when she was seen a while back it was usually in or around HC systems. Apparently a few of your more savvy users recall a rumor that she had a reputation for walking through HC Intrusion Countermeasures like they were nothing. She often was spotted near the Virt locations mapped to Real locations that had newly deployed HC tech and occasionally brought people on runs against HC systems. 

She was also often seen in the company of other women who called themselves Oracles. 

__The Monstrous focused on:__ A useful prompt for the possessed AI in the records room.

You focus in on the AI you encountered in The Records Room and you feel there is a lot more there that you could know. All sorts information might be guarded by similar agents to which you feel a drive to get access. The room is filled with useful information about what connects HC and The Verdant and how HC was involved in originally linking them. 

You also got a sense that the entity possessing the AI in The Records Room will grant you entrance only if you provide a boon or something that proves the possessed system is required to give you access.
