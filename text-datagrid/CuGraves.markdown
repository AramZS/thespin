Never present in person, but frequently seen holoing in to keep an eye on optics control operations HC executes all over The Enclave. Graves is meticulously kept up, while also being boringly normal looking. He wears a distinctive old fashioned black suit, a short gold tie with an HC metal symbol that serves both as a tie pin and as the center of a chain that uses clips on either end to keep his laples perfectly in place. He's a dark-skinned man with slim elaborate holo glasses that are constantly alight with whatever inner projections he is looking up.

He's clued in on The Verdent. He's clued in on _everything_.
