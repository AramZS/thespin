#### Location:

The Dataverse within The Records Room system on the Moonbase

#### Met:

Tom Ridgeway - an older gentlemen in disheveled clothes and Tier 4 manager for the HC Datasci team, he lived in the Spire and has been locked in to the dataverse for 10 years. 

YS/x - Demands that you return with a boon.

The Mi-go: The Mi-go looks something like a cross between a fungus, a lobster and a bat. It is pinkish, fungoid, and crustacean-like with a "convoluted ellipsoid" composed of pyramided, fleshy rings and covered in antennae where a head would normally be. Its crustacean-like body bears numerous sets of paired appendages. It also possess a pair of membranous bat-like wings. Apparently from Pluto.

AI M3DOW: you may call him Overseer Medow. He is the primary administration AI for the HC 3rd Slice Dataverse. 

The Theta Cultists: Agents of a mysterious cult that seems to have formed out of HC employees stuck in the dataverse over the last decade. They speak of The Decayer and seem to be allied with the Mi-go. They have distinctive dark brown robes withy black stoles and a Î¸ symbol on the back or front. They move very fast, can use magic and seem to have some interest in maintaining the state of the Dataverse, or perhaps have just resigned themselves to it. 

#### Game On:
