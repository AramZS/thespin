"Look at all these tasty enhancements, wouldn't you rather level up like me then end up a monster like her" _Swollows another microtransaction pill_

Stretched and tall when Zeroth smiles all that's inside is a whirlpool maw, an empty pool leading down into infinite blackness. He wears a mismatched assortment of parts and enhancements, on one arm is a mega-man style plaster, on the other a long red claw. He wears a full head helmet with sharp blade fins rising out of it like a set of mohowks. He's paid to play, every thing on him runs by the grace of payments to HC.

Nihilist Changeling who works for HC. He has an addiction to micro-payments and a significant level of skill. But the last time you encountered him you and he ended up battling and him coming out the lesser. When you first met he tried to recruit you to HC's side.
