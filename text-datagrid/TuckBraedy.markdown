brief: Ex-CFO of HC, presidential candidate
---

Despite living most his life in The Enclave, presidential candidate and ex-CFO of HC John Dyer has garnered little support from his hometown, one of the most populous regions he would be responsible for as President. Polls find that, at least in the case of Dyer, familiarity does indeed breed contempt. Enclave residents polled him the lowest among the current candidates, a stat which coincides with their especially low consideration of HC in general.
