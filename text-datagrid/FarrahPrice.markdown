brief: The Oracle of Clock, lost in your first encounter with a daemon.

Dr. Karen Wathey owns a spiritualism store in The Corner Marketplace and has somehow managed to infer a lot of the practice of magic without knowing a true thing about it.

In exchange for her help on Case 0 you purchased a rather expensive crystal ball from her and have ended up signed up for her email list. 

She has pale skin, long curley hair, big eyes and big glasses and her ability to look slightly amazed at everything covers up the fact that she is a rather savey businessperson.
