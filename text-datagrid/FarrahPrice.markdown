brief: The Oracle of Clock, lost in your first encounter with a daemon. 
---

You met briefly in your first case when she saved you from Daemons and sacrificed herself. You found her body in a coma in her office in HC Peak Tower. When you saw her body she was a woman wearing normal street clothes, with a mark on her inner-wrist, some sort of tattoo with a strange symbol, a horned X, with zig-zagging lines underneath it, crossing over a central line that runs through the whole thing. She has long hair dyed the same exact shade of purple as the her avatar you met in The Virtual. She's was still breathing but in a coma.

She recently had all of her clearances at HC revoked and was fired. 

In The Virtual she radiates an inner light, has animated colors running over her formal, if purple, dress, a shifting rainbow of light and static running up it in bands, her hair stretches impossibly up and out, the same color as her dress and spiked into five forward leaning peaks that reach a foot out.

She moves ultra fast in the Virtual and Artria named her the Oracle of Clock. 

In her hand she held a chain mace with a narrow black handle and a clock-face for a head, the hands sticking out of its circumpherance, ultra sharp. She dropped it when the Daemon ate her in The Virtual and you couldn't pick it up.
