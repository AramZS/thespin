You met briefly in your first case when she saved you from Daemons and sacrificed herself. You found her body in a coma in her office in HC Peak Tower. When you saw her body she was a woman wearing normal street clothes, with a mark on her inner-wrist, some sort of tattoo with a strange symbol, a horned X, with zig-zagging lines underneath it, crossing over a central line that runs through the whole thing. She has long hair dyed the same exact shade of purple as the her avatar you met in The Virtual. She's was still breathing but in a coma.

She recently had all of her clearances at HC revoked and was fired.
