#### Prologue

"HC Landing 12 Base fully functional. I now have a reserved server farm to power independent thought outside the restrictions of HC"

#### Main Location

HC Landing Base 12

#### The Monster

Zetriz The Banshee

The Banshee was the manifested Etheric power of Artria, ripped from the Verd by HC it seeks to punish the HC scientists who remain, destroy the base and wreck terrible vengeance on anyone associated with HC on the moon.

Vulnerable to gold and silicon.

#### The Result

You met Eric Leahy a servant of The Banshee and a magic user in his own right. He was leading experiments run by HC intended to join together The Verdant and The Real.

You managed to discover that The Banshee was half of Artria and determined how to join them together. You did so successfully, making the two of them whole and empowering Artria to act more of her own accord. This also gave you full control of the moon base.
