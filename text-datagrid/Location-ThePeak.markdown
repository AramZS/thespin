The Peak is the headquarters of HC and the central tower of The Enclave. It is also the repository of most of The Virtual's infrastructure and a number of heavily firewalled and air-gapped Virtual spaces. 

Last time you were in The Peak you found yourself spit out into Farrah Price's office. 

The Heap is a secure space somewhere in The Peak.
