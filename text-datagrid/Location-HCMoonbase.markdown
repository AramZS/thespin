Welcome to the HermitCorp Moon Base, founded during a secret 12th moon landing, it was to created by HC in order to expand what they did and could do in The Verdent, the mystical realm that has been lashed to The Virtual. This was their base for a number of secret experiments on The Verd and its inhabitants. The last one they did was attempt to force a "Flare", a manifestation of the Verdent into the real world. The hope was that they could create permanent manifestations, creating something out of nothing in the real world using magic.

This spectacularly backfired.

They attempted (led by ) to bring a powerful fairy into the real, but instead managed to split the entity in half. They permenently manifested and stranded the part of her that is her raw power, creating a near mindless enraged banshee, Zetriz, that killed, or magically forced into survatude everyone on the base. The core intelligence became enslaved to HC but stuck in The Virtual unable to reach The Verdent without its power. That became Artria [Are-tree-ah]. Artria is unaware that part of herself is on the base, she just knows that it was abandoned and is now out of the reach of HC, even if it was where she first came into contact with HC and our world. This is the only place she can talk freely to the players so she managed to bring them here and with the boon from YS/x she's managed to activate and power it up. This particular boon is tied to a part of YS/x called Gomory (one of the globes).

The Control Room is off-center and leads into a hub of three other hallways, each hallway curls around to another matching corridor and all are also connected by an outer ring corridor:
