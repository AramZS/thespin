CEO of HermitageCorp.

The Mother of Daemons called him a Warlock and you discovered a recording of him demanding that she continue to draw power out of The Verdant to drive his own interests. 

He had hopped to secure an escape route out of our plane of existence with the help of the Mi-Go until that plan was thwarted when his dishonesty was revealed. 

Under his oversight The Virtual has essentially become a tool for fracking power out of The Verdant.
