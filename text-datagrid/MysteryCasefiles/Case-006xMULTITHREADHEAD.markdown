#### Prologue

"There were changelings who did not become oracles, but they became other things, some became little better than Daemons in their own right, some were lost, and many we put to sleep. But now the link between The Real and The Verdant, the space we call The Virtual, has become destabilized, and power is on the move."

Virt failures in WeCentWa have caused unrest and now more EPD and Free Battalion manage border control between WeCentWa and the Mids, but Enclave Residents aren't the only ones interested in making their way to the upper levels. 

#### Main Location

The border between WeCentWa and WeCentMid

#### The Monster

The Gorgon

Her eyes have been replaced with mirror lenses, dark glass inset into her face that looks like lenses. They glow around the borders of the glass, where it meets skin, with etheric green power. She wears what appears to have been a smart dark suit now fadded and tattered into a uniform gray color. Her skin is a pale gray and her fingers are capped with sharp metal fingernails. Atop her head snakes flicker back and forth whirling while also shifting in form from snakes, to metal blades, to sparking wires.

#### The Result

The Gorgon Awakens. Without even thinking she begins to coma people in The Real, pull their etheric spirit into The Virtual, where she turns them into stone and slowly drains their etheric energy until they die in the Real. She begins climbed through The Vert from WestCentWa to WestCentMid. You also noticed that The Wall seemed to have some strange failures. 

You also encountered Zeroth a hacker working for HC who has some real power in The Virtual, but is bound by HC via an addiction to microtransactions. He seemed to be working with the gorgon, or manipulating her. 

At the end you found yourself facing off against a Gorgon, awoken only recently, who was drawing power out of people in The Real, causing them to fall into comas and then eventually die.

She seemed protected by Zeroth, who you fought almost to death, but let him live badly hurt and stripped of some of his HC Gear. 

You made your way into the Gorgon's demesne and fought. The Mother of Daemons showed up with an interest in her and in you but you managed to banish the MoD. 

You defeated the Gorgon. Some of her victims woke up, whom you saved as a result, but it was clear that her intent had more to do with her interest in absorbing energy to change her situation in some way.
