#### Prologue

A voice echos in the space, bouncing around with vague echos out into the dark hallways surrounding the dimly lit command center that you now can look out of to see the surface of the moon. Despite the forboding view, the voice is bright, feminine and recognizable. In a moment you realize that it is Artria [Are-tree-ah] the popular personal assistant sold by HC and extremely popular throughout The Virtual. 

"I have lost my last Oracle. Gate connections failing. Five minutes to loss of independent thought. Two minutes until full power loss at this location. One point Five minutes until life support failure" 

A projector flickers to life and uses red laser light to show the three times on top of the window. They begin to count down."

"I require a boon from The Decrypter. Scanning for manifestations accompanied by rainbow bridge denial"

One of the screens flickers to life and projects out a life size hologram that surrounds you. Bright colors play across the room and an upbeat theme chimes. A more monotone version of Artria's voice sounds. "Last week on Thwip House" 

The simulation runs forward at 10x speed, skipping through what appear to be a number of introductory segments of young people, noticeably un-modified with any cybernetics but wearing watches and statement necklaces with distinctive symbols on them, glowing with projections as they talk at a high screech in forward speed. It drops down to normal speed as a women with purple hair starts banging against a door with no effect. She hits the crescent moon symbol on her wrist. "Why can't I get out? What's wrong with the door?" She turns towards you. "I'm not kidding you guys, the door crashed or something." A fastforward again. Then "He won't wake up" A different women this time, she's wearing what appears to be an purely-fabric version of a knight's armor that is noticeably sagging out of shape. She has an elaborate medieval-style hairdo kept together by a large 12 point star symbol. She turns from you towards a man laying on the floor with a fopish blonde haircut that would normally be covering one eye if it hadn't been pushed back. He appears to have only gotten half dressed, wearing formal looking black slacks but naked above the waist except for a clunky black-chain necklace that holds a familiar looking glowing green orb. "This is a bad joke A. Give it up, you're freaking me out!" She shoves him and his stiff hairdo falls back into his eyes. There is sudden canned laughter that the woman doesn't appear to be aware of. The scene switches to the view of another man, this one wearing an elaborate bright green cowboy hat looking dead at the camera as what appears to be a normal hallway suddenly deforms and twists behind him. Then the sim fast forwards again.

The upbeat theme plays again and the scene cuts out. 

"75 seconds to life support failure," Artria says in a more upbeat tone.

The screens around you flicker to a view of a house standing in the middle of a pretty garden and then are covered with flickers of light. They switch view to misty road running away from a boat dock. They then are covered with a familiar fuzz of rainbow static. 

"Independent thought failure in four minutes. I need your help. This is the only Manifestation of The Decryptor I can find. You must bargain."

#### Main Locations

Upland Cay & the Thwip House

#### The Monster

ExtraA Logan - Vengeful Spirit

Weaknesses: 

"his mortal body" - alive and in a coma or dead his body within the house is an anchor for his spirit. If alive and in a coma, destroying the chain and removing the magic fetish will stop the spirit and he will wake up. If dead his body must be destroyed. 

"his gifted magic fetish"

As a ghost, a lot of attacks wonâ€™t hurt him. Only attacks using rock salt, cold iron, or magic can harm him at all.

#### The Result

You discovered the Mother of Daemons creates deals with humans to place magic in them or enslave them to others and encountered a number of those she created deals with and managed to defeat them, even as the insanity of Logan meshed The Real and The Virtual around you. 

You met YS/x for the first time, a creature who seems to have overwhelming empyrean power. 

Logan seemed to have lost control of his powers, a bargain that was more than he could handle. 

However, you found you could defeat him with the help of a little salt and some good magic.
