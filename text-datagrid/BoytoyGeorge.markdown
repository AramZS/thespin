brief: Hung with the Rollerz before the Keyfall. He worked with you briefly during the SoCentWa protests and was knocked out.

SoCentWa representative to the Borough Council. Balding, dressed well but inexpensively. He is occasionally righteously angry (for good reason) and has done a good job representing SoCentWa for three terms. You met him briefly while he was being interviewed by Wrad Marge. 

He is the last remaining major figure of the SoCentWa Rollerz and significantly involved in the local protest movement.
