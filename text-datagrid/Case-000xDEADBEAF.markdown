__The Spin:__ [2106/02/28](http://thespin.glitch.me/archive/2108-02-28)

#### Prologue

It's a Saturday. Today is your monthly game in The Virtual. You all came together for a reason. Last year, at this time, the three of you were plugged in when an amazingly rare event occured, The Virtual, a VR internet that connects everything in the world, including holograms, physical screens and plugged in VR glasses, fitzed out. You all received a shock to your system and when you woke up hours later in The Real you found yourselves endowed with something a little extra-normal. It seemed silly to call it magic, but what else *could* you call it? Strange things happened at your will in The Real, almost like the types of games you played in The Vert were leaking out into normal life. But it isn't just that, you started to find The Vert bending to your will a lot more readily than you were used to. Between now and then life has happened, strange encounters that you tried to write off, but couldn't. Strange information has started appearing in your heads. And sometimes, strange inclinations. Weird abilities and deformations. You've had strange encounters in The Virt, and outside as you've discovered and gotten involved with people in The Real who have had the same type of strange powers you did. You've stretched the limits, though, and there were serious limits, none of your strange new powers were easy to use or dependable. 

#### Main Location

The Corner Marketplace

#### The Monster

You went up against rouge empowered taxidermist Lawerence Beech. With the help of The Mother of Daemons he gained enough magical energy to enchant his creations and combine them with cybernetics to create crazy creatures. He's had moved into a hidden workshop through the fiber-tunnels behind his old shop and was putting the touches on daemon/cybernetic modifications to his taxidermic creations in order to take over the Marketplace and then capture humans to turn into his minions. 

#### The Result

You defeated Beech and stabilized The Virtual in the corner marketplace. The Mother of Daemon's showed up and stole a ball of green energy out from his failing body.
