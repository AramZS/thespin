A protest leader, organizer with Wall Techs & Vators / Vents Local 366, against HC's neglect of the Virtual Access given to the Wall-ys. Their unstable connections and data holes make it harder and harder to make a living. The flares making life downright dangerous.

You met him very briefly during the protests in SoCentWa.
