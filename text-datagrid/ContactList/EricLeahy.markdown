He is an Interface Tech, which means he has visible ports at the back of his spine, a once shaved head now gone shaggy, and a number of mechanisms that now glow with Etheric light that run down his arms. He wears the rags of a uniform More crudely he has implanted gold circuits in his skin, which do little practical but help keep the Banshee from messing with him. If he gets into physical combat with the players he'll start bleeding from his crude gold metal implants. His pockets are stuffed with broken circuit board and gold-plated wiring.

He's still stuck in an empowered circle on The Moonbase.

Before spending 10 years trapped in the moonbase he worked for HC on their project to use The Verdant to materialize objects into The Real. He's responsible for splitting Artria and pulling her mostly into our world.
