**Beserk**

No matter how much harm you take, you can always keep going until the current fight is over. During a fight, the Keeper may not use harm moves on you and you cannot die. When the fight ends, all harm takes effect as normal.

**Tools Matter**

With your signature weapon (see your gear, below), you get +1 to kick some ass.

Her Signature Weapon is a punch dagger

The other teens sort of see this as something fun but she sees this as something that comes out of what was taken from her and her powers come from her anger. She has become their defacto leader. 

She can come and go from the moon and access the research lab freely, but only by herself. 

Briefed Madra on everything that's going on.
