brief: Free Battalion Team Leader

Nadia commands the team of Free Battalion Mercs that maintain order against those who might damage HC's property or image. She's loyal to the word of her contract with HC and a superb fighter and beloved commander.

Usually carries an assault rifle. 

Like all the Free Battalion she wears the bladed Anubis helmet and is distinguished only by a set of rank lines painted on her chest. 

Her current assignment, along with almost all of the Free Battalion in The Enclave, is working for HC to provide extra security against troublemakers protesting Virt failures.
