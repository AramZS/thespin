Trapped in Entity Storage, the return of power to the ES server has awoken him and others who are now stuck in a Virtual room unsure what to do next. He wants to help you. He lived on the borderlands, in a town that he took you across the Riverwalk to get to. The town is in shambles, ravaged by creatures. He has sharply pointed ears and long fingers, but otherwise looks like a normal human.
