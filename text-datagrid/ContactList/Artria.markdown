brief: Multipart being only now reclaiming her identity after years fractured by HC

An Elvan Princess, a caster of superior power. She was split by HC as part of their attempts to create a closer connection with The Verdant that would allow them to pull things from there into our world and visa versa. 

You have recently discovered that she was there when The Virtual began and may have known The Mother of Daemons. However, she has seemed plagued with memory loss.

She is one of the few beings capable of creating equal-energy-exchange portals. 

When Artria was pulled out of The Verdant by HC she was split into three pieces. One became the Banshee. One became the "AI" assistant that is used by almost all Virtual users. The third was sent to The Heap, a Virtual space firewalled in The HC Peak.
