You've returned to a relatively stable moonbase. 

Most of the standard humans are off base leaving you with

an unconscious Eric Leahy (Trapped in the Summoning Circle Lab)<br />
a disembodied Cor Larana (Trapped in the Summoning Circle Lab)<br />
the inhabitants of Entity Storage (Trapped there)<br />
Divi the Droid, <br />
and Artria of course. <br />

Also remaining, if a little less clear in their purpose:

the body of Brea Rush (who you met in Entity Storage)<br />
Inquiry AI 334 - Installed in the Records Room - Partially controlled by Gomory an etheric component of YS/x<br />
Eliabeth (Elli) Cordova, who has remained aboard trying to get your help to find the missing Antim Quinn. <br />

When we last left off it was clear that the Mother of Daemons has been manipulating people and manifesting power and possession into The Real, your most recent encounter left you with the sense that she was trying to push things from The Verdent into The Real. HC had been experimenting with the same idea on the moonbase, with their best result being Artria (though her manifestation resulted in half stuck in The Virtual, half insane in The Real). 

The result of these manifestations have been globes of energy that you've seen the Mother of Daemons handling, taking away from failed enemies; the empowering and later possession of Eric Leahy, and the body-part possessions that you saw during the activity in SoCentWa. The flares in SoCentWa also seem to be the result of the Mother trying to push things through the border. 

You also now know that The Virtual runs as a part, empowered and interesting with, The Verdant a realm different from our own but nearby. At first HC tapped into this power source inadvertently but now does so quite purposefully. 

Finally, a decade ago, when Artria first was pulled by HC into the AI system that provides support to many users of The Virtual, she called upon the decedents of Changelings that had been sent to The Real centuries ago to help stop the Daemons that the connection between The Verdant and The Real seemed to summon to attack humans in The Virtual. These were The Oracles and they died fighting off the Daemons. When Artria recently awoke and pulled you in for help you saw the last of them get eaten by a Daemon.
