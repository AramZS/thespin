Mysterious woman with Daemon teeth, a dark-green fedora, and a tendency to show up near green globes of power. 

She wishes to wreck havoc with vengeance upon HC CEO John Dyer, whom she blames for stranding her in The Verdant for a decade. 

You have learned that she was there, part of the team that initially connected The Virtual with The Verdant. Back then her real name was Antim Quinn and she may have been the first human to enter The Verdant under her own power.
