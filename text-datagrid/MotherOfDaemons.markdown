Mysterious woman with Daemon teeth, a dark-green fedora, and a tendency to show up near green globes of power. 

She wishes to wreck havoc with vengeance upon HC CEO John Dyer, whom she blames for stranding her in The Verdant for a decade. 

You have learned that she was there, part of the team that initially connected The Virtual with The Verdant. Back then her real name was Antim Quinn and she may have been the first human to enter The Verdant under her own power. 

For the first time the public now knows her name and some of her role in creating The Virtual. 

Before she was banashed by John Dyer to The Verdant she had been trying to disconnect The Verdant from The Virtual, or at least make the process by which they were connected less cannibalistic of The Virtual's energy. 

She was a mentor to Eliabeth (Elli) Cordova, who she saw something of herself in, as they were both engineers who had made their way up from the Wall districts through excellence in their work.

She attempted to sound the alarm on the fact that HC is essentially fracking The Verdant for energy and hurting that world by doing so. 

She seems to have been changed significantly by her banishment, or some other aspect of her experience fighting John Dyer.
