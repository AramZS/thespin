Composed of 13 rainbow-static-filled globes glowing with an almost blinding empyrean magic each globe has its own name and to avoid overwhelming the players only one will speak to them at a time. An entity translated from The Verdent but rather inhuman in its interactions with you. It sounds and acts more programmatic and mechanical than normal beings of The Virtual and speaks almost in code. 

Usually represented as 13 rainbow-static-filled globes glowing with an almost blinding empyrean magic.
