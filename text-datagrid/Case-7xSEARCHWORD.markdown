#### Prologue

Letters:

__The Crooked asked:__ What is the state of the allegiances between the criminal underworld and the factions of law enforcement? 

Some factions of the EPD have been receiving significant bribes, some believe laundered from HC, to ignore reports of a particular nature (the weird). A faction of criminals have begun to nose into these payments and been using them to get in with bribe-ready or blackmail-able cops. The cops have, as a result, basically been providing hints about where incidents have occurred and left criminals to do clean up. A Russian import, the Vory V Zakone have used to opportunity to both expanded their protection business and put quite a few cops in their pockets.

It is believed that the alliances between the Vory and the EPD in the wake of these bribes has changed the power structure, moving from a smaller group led by a Vory (a criminal who climbed the ranks) to a Avtoritet (a government official of some sort who runs things from a distance)

Notably a less organized grouping of criminals has connected these incidents with people falling into comas and taken the opportunity to rob them.

__The Luchador asked:__ Had anyone met The Oracle of Clocks, where, when and in what context? 

No one has seen the avatar you described recently, but when she was seen a while back it was usually in or around HC systems. Apparently a few of your more savvy users recall a rumor that she had a reputation for walking through HC Intrusion Countermeasures like they were nothing. She often was spotted near the Virt locations mapped to Real locations that had newly deployed HC tech and occasionally brought people on runs against HC systems. 

She was also often seen in the company of other women who called themselves Oracles. 

__The Monstrous focused on:__ A useful prompt for the possessed AI in the records room.

You focus in on the AI you encountered in The Records Room and you feel there is a lot more there that you could know. All sorts information might be guarded by similar agents to which you feel a drive to get access. The room is filled with useful information about what connects HC and The Verdant and how HC was involved in originally linking them. 

You also got a sense that the entity possessing the AI in The Records Room will grant you entrance only if you provide a boon or something that proves the possessed system is required to give you access.

#### Game On:

The Crooked's sources in the criminal underworld have been reporting that the Cosa Nostra, the primary underworld gang in The Enclave, has recently found itself on a back foot fighting the [Vory V Zakone](https://shadowrun.fandom.com/wiki/Vory). The Vory have found themselves at an advantage as their enforcers have been undergoing a ritual called "puteshestviye k rechnym zemlyam - Journey to the Riverlands" which seem to grant those who undergo it a significantly enhanced set of capabilities without having to undergo expensive grafts or cybernetic enhancements. The Vory have used this opportunity to both expanded their protection business and put quite a few cops in their pockets. The Mob, in an attempt to follow suit, have developed their own ritual (acqua al maestro - Water to the Master) and begun to empower some of their own enforcers, but it has caused issues in the existing Cosa Nostra power structure and started to create rifts between them and their established traditional mercs.

WeCentWa has been put into complete lockdown following what EPD are calling a terrorist incident at the main transit station that allows movement between Western Wall boroughs and any of the mids or upper levels. This is causing a particular problem as WeCentWa is already overloaded with refugees who moved into camps on the streets following an evacuation from WeSoWa, a next door borough. Exacerbating this situation further is the increasing flares at the western wall boroughs have been increasing technical failures, disrupting connections to The Virtual, and causing the Wall's active filtering and water handling systems to fail, this caused the flood in WeSoWa and it is causing water leakage all over WeCentWa, alarming residents who see an inability to get to the mids as a potential death sentence should another area of the west walls flood. 

In your investigation of the situation you found a local chapter of the Cosa Nostra, mostly disgruntled and feeling pressure from the Russian Vory, in the local restaurant Grub and Go. You were ignored by Al Hensah, the underwhelming cook, and you spoke with Mart Quats, an overweight tracksuit-wearing man with an Italian accent who offered you money and allies in exchange for pushing out the local lideri (aka chapter) of the Vory who have taken over a street he call 'Ruski Road' a few blocks away and have been using it as a base of operations. You agreed to help him out. 

You also saw for yourself the rift that is forming between the Cosa Nostra's enforcers, learning from Stafford Lynch, a merc with significant jaguar mods, that they have been moving work over to internal folks who look unmodified but can somehow hold their own. 

You then explored the area that the Vory have taken over, a block of dilapidated three-level brownstones with stores on the bottom floors, including an abandoned and torn up chinese restaurant, Jenny's bar (which you saw having its owner being shook down by a Vory member), and Real Enclave Cafe The Best tm, which appeared to have a Vory hangout in the back that you snuck into. The hideout had a gun safe (from which you pulled all the firing pins), a ritual kit, which you stole the knife out of, that looked like it was meant to tap into the power of The Verdant, records of them shaking down various parts of the neighborhood for protection money and bribing at least one local EPD. There was also just a ton of empty alcohol bottles. 

While investigating the joined backyard of this block The Monstress transformed into a flying squirrel and was able to hear a high pitched pattern of sounds that was coming from the borough's Core Park. You investigated and found more refugees at the edge of the park, but none in the center, as they were afraid of something there that was rumored to be taking people. Some of the refugees have become a fan of The Luchodor for his casts showing the poor conditions and garnering public support for the refugees on The Virtual. 

The Core Park is divided into a huge sculpture garden, with each section showing different types of sculptures and as you investigated you found one that came to life. A gargoyle who claimed to be part of a group. It attacked you and you had it on the ropes when it was catapulted away in a single punch by an enthusiastic Vory enforcer Prit Astoky (who you noticed seemed to have power running through him). Prit claimed he was there just to knock it back but not to kill it, so he could continue collecting protection money from the refugee camp. When you didn't go along with him, he left, and was angry at you and no longer considering you a possible ally. 

After your encounter you also met Adel Martinez and Aethelbert (Bertie) Butler two refugees and amateur detectives who were investigating how the Vory became such a plague on the local refugee camp and told you about their strange rituals.

You were stopped in your investigation by Officer Kooring Macquarie who was on the take with the local Vory lideri, however you convinced him that the Vory were too dangerous, their recent activities threatening the soundness of The Enclave's flood walls and were able to talk your way out of an encounter.

You tracked one of the Gargoyles through its weakness to daylight to the abandoned Chinese restaurant but when you were on the edge of defeating it, the Mother of Daemons intervened. She and her giant hound protected it enough to get away but not before she revealed to you that she has been using the disruptive nature of interactions between The Verdant and The Real in order to break through the security between the levels of The Enclave in order to destroy the HC and The Virtual and then find and assassinate the CEO of HermitageCorp, whom she blames for being stuck in The Verdant for the last decade and for tearing her from those she cared about. You decided you'd get to him and eliminate him first.

She warned you not to interfere with the changelings who have been awakening and emerging from The Verdant in monstrous form, coinciding with her arrival back in The Virtual after being stranded to wander The Verdant for the last decade. She also warned you off interfering with the empowered humans. You also found that the Gargoyles actually are statues possessed by changelings who spirits were stuck in The Verdant but have recently been passing through or into The Virtual to emerge into The Real.

In your encounter you almost managed to separate the spirit possessing the stone form from it's physical anchor with a combination of a magic containment circle and a banishment. You may remember that this isn't the first time you managed this, as you did the same thing on the moonbase to separate Eric Lehey from the possession of Cor Larana.

You then staked out the Vory hideout in the bodega, and saw them initiate an empowerment ritual. You broke it up and were forced to kill the local Vory leadership of Sylvia Lind and empowered Vory enforcer Prit Astoky. In the combat and the beginning of the ritual you saw a significant uptick in flairs, even to the point of one of Lind's attacks on you being a literal ball of reality disruption. As you were about to clean up the situation Bertie Butler stepped into the empowerment circle and power flowed into him causing him to pass out. Unsure what would happen next you sent him to the moonbase to be watched over by Artria.

You managed to defeat the gargoyles, including banishing Phil the Metal Gargoyle to be a stable person in The Verdant.

Al Hensah, is going to be their contact for the Cosa Nostra and will tell them all about future Vory incursions.

You also made friends with Bella, mob wizard. 

Purchased the equipment to make one anti-magic amulet and formal armor for The Luchador, with silver green accents and glowing bits.

Finally, you managed to stop the flooding that was going to sink WeCentWa.
