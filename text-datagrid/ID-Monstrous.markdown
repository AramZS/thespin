Administrates the Magical Laboratory in the moonbase. You have a mystical lab with all kinds of weird ingredients and tools useful for casting spells (like the use magic move, big magic, and any other magical moves). 

**You've unlocked a new move:**

**The Beast among us**: you've habitually given in to your monstrous nature and in doing so you've only gotten creepier, people will now automatically find you off putting and no longer assume your just a gangster with weird grafts. Now when you Manipulate Someone or try to help with a Manipulate take -1.

You may now roll +Weird to frighten the living daylights out of someone during combat instead. On a 10+ select 1; on a 7 - 9 select 2 or consider it a failure with no effects; on a failure (5 or less) choose three from the list.

List:

you scare them so much they will not go near you during the remainder of combat;
they run away screaming;
they're calling for help to take you out;
they send out a message to warn everyone about you (-1 to all Manipulate Someone rolls forward);
they are frightened to the point of snapping and focus their attacks on you and nothing will convince them to stop;
