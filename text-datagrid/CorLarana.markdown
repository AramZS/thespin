Grey-skinned with a green sheen, especially on the scales that cap her shoulder-blades she looks mostly human otherwise, beyond rather far apart overly round and glassy eyes and rather small ears. A close examination will show slight webbing between her fingers. She was stuck in Entity Control and ended up possessing Eric Leahy before you banished her to become a disembodied spirit. She's pretty pissed at you for foiling her.
