Activated when the rest of the station was powered up, Divi is roaming the halls performing its duty of making sure nothing with a signal matching The Verdent escapes from one of the containment rooms. The guard isn't meant to do much combat on its own and is a spindly thing, with two arms with three fingered claws and small lasers mounted on each arm, it sits on top of two treaded wheels with a thin body and a oversized round head containing many camera eyes.

At some point someone painted a smiley face on the front of the transparent dome of its head. Divi isn't happy about that.
