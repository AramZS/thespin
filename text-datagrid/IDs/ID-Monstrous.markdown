Almost Slayed by Guy Flanders and then proved that she was on the side of good. "I too had an uncle that was misunderstood but he choose light. and I saw that in Cindy."

Administrates the Magical Laboratory in the moonbase. You have a mystical lab with all kinds of weird ingredients and tools useful for casting spells (like the use magic move, big magic, and any other magical moves). 

Burn Everything: When you use magic to inflict harm, you can choose to inflict 3-harm area magic obvious or 3-harm ignore-armour magic obvious.

**You've unlocked a new move:**

**The Beast among us**: you've habitually given in to your monstrous nature and in doing so you've only gotten creepier, people will now automatically find you off putting and no longer assume your just a gangster with weird grafts. Now when you Manipulate Someone or try to help with a Manipulate take -1.

You may now roll +Weird to frighten the living daylights out of someone during combat instead. On a 10+ select 1; on a 7 - 9 select 2 or consider it a failure with no effects; on a failure (5 or less) choose three from the list.

**Transmit**: You can go instantly to anywhere you’ve visited before, or to a person you know well as long as they are not isolated from electronics. When you carry one or two people with you, roll +Weird. On a 10+ you all go where you wanted. On a 7-9, you don’t quite manage it. Either you are all separated, or you all appear in the wrong place. 

**What Does Not Kill Me...**: If you have suffered harm in a fight, you gain +1 ongoing until the fight is over.

**The Big Whammy**: You can use your powers to kick some ass: roll +Weird instead of +Tough. The attack has 2-harm close obvious ignore-armour. On a miss, you’ll get a magical backlash.

**Force of Will**: When you apply your will to dispelling a magical effect, blocking a spell, or suspending a Phehomenon, roll +Weird. On a hit, momentary magics are cancelled completely, and long-lasting spells and effects are suspended temporarily. On a 10+, you can also spend Luck to instantly snuff out a powerful spell or strange effect. On a 7-9, you take 1-harm as the strain of dismissing magic unravels you.

List:

you scare them so much they will not go near you during the remainder of combat;
they run away screaming;
they're calling for help to take you out;
they send out a message to warn everyone about you (-1 to all Manipulate Someone rolls forward);
they are frightened to the point of snapping and focus their attacks on you and nothing will convince them to stop;
