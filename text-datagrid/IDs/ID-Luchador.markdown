**You've unlocked a new move**:

**Influencer**: +Charm you've made it into the common eye as a Luchodor and have loyal fans clamoring for your attention at all times. Using your intrinsic connection to The Virtual you can manifest your fans for the duration of any encounter to fight with you. Consider this a gang of 10 summoned insanely loyal Luchador fans, all dressed in avatars that look like off-brand versions of your own. They will each be carrying your signature weapon, or any weapon you have previously used that is not a gun. They do +1 harm, get +1 armor and may be rolled separately as a Kick Some Ass move. They may take up to 5 harm before dissipating, but will dissipate instantly if you fail a combat role while they are active.

On a 10+ they manifest for the duration of the scene, on a 7 to 9 they'll only come through if you impress them with an cool successful Kick Some Ass first, on a failure you come one step closer to being challenged by your sworn enemy fighter.
