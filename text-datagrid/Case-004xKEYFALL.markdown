#### Prologue

A Keyfall rained down on SoCentWa, exacerbating the complaints of the citizens who live there and have been ignored by EPD and HC as their interfaces with The Virtual became less stable and Flares started causing weird events in the area. The heavily biomechanically modified Roller Derby Team and Gang RyotGuuurls was causing chaos before, but now has become lead organizers in a full blown active protest in SoCentWa Square. Their leader (though now only in the gang, and not the Roller Derby) Sasha "Sash" Shovegood believes that there must be a key to the service elevators that would allow free access to SoCentMid. Sash believes that breaking out into the Mids (which have, thus far, been free of the Flares) and causing damage and chaos is the only way to get attention to the trouble occuring in SoCentWa and she has been organizing a search (which you helped with) for the key. She hasn't found it yet.

#### Main Location

SoCentWa Main Square

#### The Monster

The Variokaryon [varioh-carie-ohn] - Sasha "Sash" Shovegood:

"It's me and my crew and we're going to take down the pigs and burn those uppers out."

"I'd do anything for this town"

Leads the protests, but quit the Vert team months ago when SoCentWa entered what was basically lockdown. Always threw herself bodily into games, often need bio or mech grafts to repair the damage. Became addicted to the grafts. Shares its body with a Daemon. Faces have been grafted all over her body by Dr. Cole, she hides them under a long grey trenchcoat.

She is tall, bulky with mustle and constantly wears a grim expression under a clean-shod dome.

Weak against fire and face damage

#### The Result

Dr. Juan Cole runs a cheap cybersurgery clinic in SoCentWa that has been the main source of biomechanical grafts (both needed and optional) for the area. He was using the debt RyotGuurls member Susan "Suze" B. Agony was in to him in order to have her help him perform his own search through the results of the Keyfall on behalf of "his mistress".

Angiophages, parasites from The Verdent, are able to enter some of the humans and spread, as they build up their power they are able to possess a part of the human they are in - the human's heart - animate it, eat their way out of their host and go looking for more. You've seen one and managed to banish another, but where there's one there's more.

The growing protest (or riot, depending on who you ask) in SoCentWa Square has only grown, The Enclave Police Department has sent reinforcements, including previous collaborator with you Claire Guimaras. The square has become more active recently and the police have pulled out riot gear and are starting to fire beanbags to keep the crowd in the square. Wrad Marge, ex-Roller Derby champion and special correspondent to news organization The Spin, has met you but is currently focused mostly on covering the protest.

HermatigeCorp (or HC) has already taken a bunch of damage to its property in SoCentWa (Ad Sim emitters and Public Flattabs mostly) and has hired a contingent of the Free Battalion, a mercenary group best known for their fierce loyalty to their contracts and bladded Anubis-head-helmets. After an unknown group believed to be led by the RyotGuurls killed a number of the mercenaries in the Free Battalion's temporary base at a local diner, a full contingent is being sent down to reinforce EPD and keep the Wall-eis contained.

The Luchodor has become a minor celebraty supporting the cause of the SoCentWa citizens with the power of his fanbase.

Sash sent Suze and her friend Boytoy George to collect more keys with you, during which time you killed and hurt a number of Free Battalion mercenaries in a diner. Suze left with most of the keys the Free Battalion had collected and then she hurt and knocked out George, but thanks to your intervention Suze now believes that George is dead. Sash doesn't understand why Suze would be a traitor, but believes it. Suze and Dr. Juan Cole's girlfriend Christher Armsstrong both had the same distinctive stitching around their grafts, likely a flourish of a single surgeon. Likely Cole himself, as Christher was passing out flyers to get more people to get grafts at Cole's clinic (not something her fellow RyotGuurls were a fan of).

You eventually confronted Sash and she revealed her monstrous nature. She could not be allowed to continue to the Uppers and you were able to defeat her, though not before most of her RyotGuurls fell to either her unleashed monsterous nature, the infused power gifted by The Mother of Daemons or conflict between you, the RyotGuurls and the Free Battalion
