Another small suburban town about an hour from The Enclave and filled with retirees. This one is distinguished from some of the others because after the Great Flood they managed to drain and dry some large tracts of accompanying land, helped by levies they had built (though needed to improve after) before the Great Flood. Some small amount of it has been converted to corn farmland while the rest has been left to grow on its own, creating a misty and humid moor that few venture into.

The town square is cobbled and surrounded by a bakery (where Paisley Lloyd is), a number of other small shops, a general store, and The Suburban Isle Pub. Everything around is purposefully quaint and has well polished facades and construction, indicating care. The main road from the docks leads into the square while the road out leads up a nearby hill to a large red farm building that sits next to a grain silo. Beyond that is a small flat plain where you can see well ordered corn stalks and beyond that fog wells up over large black walls that sparkle with integrated electronics.
