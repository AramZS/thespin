MidsBlock 53515, a suburban mids town called Fivers that exemplifies by the uptight communities on the edge of the mids: outside the inner city, overlooking the floodwaters that splash up at the furthest edges of the gently sloping city sides that build up from the base of the Wall. Fivers is filled with the semi-retired, the upper middle-class remote and core-ward workers, and teens--apparently looking for any way to push their parents. It is a neighborhood where residents of more core-ward towns, where porer people live in more dense housing, must pass through heading to work in the factories and warehouses of The Wall, but get the side eye if they should stop for too long. And when you arrived from the damp city-edge transit tubes you got the side-eye too.
