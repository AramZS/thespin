MidsBlock 53515, a suburban mids town called Fivers that exemplifies by the uptight communities on the edge of the mids: outside the inner city, overlooking the floodwaters that splash up at the furthest edges of the gently sloping city sides that build up from the base of the Wall. Fivers is filled with the semi-retired, the upper middle-class remote and core-ward workers, and teens--apparently looking for any way to push their parents. It is a neighborhood where residents of more core-ward towns, where porer people live in more dense housing, must pass through heading to work in the factories and warehouses of The Wall, but get the side eye if they should stop for too long. And when you arrived from the damp city-edge transit tubes you got the side-eye too. 

A welcome sign sits about a block from the disembarkment area, across the stretch of a mostly full hover-dock lot. "Welcome to Mids Block 53515, East Northern Mids, The Fivers, a sea-side estate." At the bottom of the sign someone has applied a palm sized sticker with an abstract illustration of an eye and the words "Protected by BlockWatch." A small bus shelter sits between you and the sign. It has a large and visible camera sitting across the street looking directly at it. 

The air is already damp when you step past the sign but you can see a row of nearly identical squat two level houses, with the only differentiated being a small attic on every fourth house, all painted an off-beige color with postage-stamp lawns, each with a sprinkler running. The narrow airspace between the houses' roofs and the ceiling of the neighborhood makes the support structures for this level visible and you can see smooth white cylinders running from the floor to the ceiling visible down the length of the block down towards what seems like a denser area 10 houses deep that runs buildings all the way to the roof. Every support has a small garage that sits almost right up against it, joined to the nearby house. As you walk into the neighborhood the sprinklers all stop at once and sink back down into the ground with an audible click. It is midday but what remains is scilence and you get the distinct feeling that eyes are pearing at you out of the doorbell cameras sitting, prominently marked, to the side of each houses' front door.
