brief: Humans who have, through imbalance, come into contact with The Verdant
---

Empowered humans represent a type that has come into contact with The Verdant via some sort of ritual. Humans can be empowered by tapping into the Verdant themselves, though such a process is usually complicated, requires ritual objects and a large group. A changeling or Verdant entity with the right expertise can usually empower a human directly, but doing so--because it requires an unbalanced transfer of power from The Verdant--would physically pain the user.
