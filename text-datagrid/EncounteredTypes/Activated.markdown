brief: Humans who have managed to, through their own free will and willing embrace of The Verdant, make stable connections with etheric power from across the border.

Activated humans were first encountered in the bowels of a Theta Cultist hideout. We observed that adults who were comas were being drained of etheric energy and left permanently soulless, however teens were observed to be regularly replenishing the etheric energy in themselves. When they were free they seemed to be Activated, embracing the power of The Verdant and even generating such power themselves. They seem to be on equal power and ability with any Changeling.
