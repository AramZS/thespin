The Wall-based Vory lideris (smaller chapters of the Vory v Zakone) and chapters of the Cosa Nostra (the Mafia) have both traditionally been poor and less empowered within their larger organizations. However, your informants have told you that they have both adopted a new set of rituals that, while having some superficial differences (The Vory name theirs puteshestviye k rechnym zemlyam - Journey to the Riverlands, while the mafia call theirs acqua al maestro - water to the master) appear to involve deep meditation, a long period in The Virtual, and a return with some level of enhancement that doesn't appear to involve normal cyber or bio grafts.

The Cosa Nostra have been in The Enclave since before the walls were built and live all over the city. The Enclave's Mafia organization has been built out as a highly organized and strictly hierarchical group, but the increasing divisions between The Wall, The Mids and The Uppers has cut lines through their organization rendering their very top down communication style more obstacle than aide and leaving independent capos to take an increasing amount of power. The result is that the Mafia has found itself increasingly beset by internal politics, all while fighting EPD, HCSec and the Vory just to maintain their lines of supply and communication.
