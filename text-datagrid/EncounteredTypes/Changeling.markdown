brief: Many centuries ago a few creatures of The Verdant found out about The Real and either came over and fell in love with humans or placed spies.

Changelings are the decedents of people and creatures of The Verdant that investigated The Real a long time ago. Some time in the past the border between The Verdant and The Real wore particularly thin and some in The Verdant curious about The Real crossed over, while others, thinking we might soon be at war, placed spies. The border would thicken again and the Verdant folk on The Real side were stranded, adapted and mixed with humanity. Changelings are their decedents and, now that the border has become endangered, they can easily tap into the etheric energy of The Verdant, sometimes without even meaning to.
