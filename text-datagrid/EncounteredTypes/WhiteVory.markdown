The Wall-based Vory lideris (smaller chapters of the Vory v Zakone) and chapters of the Cosa Nostra (the Mafia) have both traditionally been poor and less empowered within their larger organizations. However, your informants have told you that they have both adopted a new set of rituals that, while having some superficial differences (The Vory name theirs puteshestviye k rechnym zemlyam - Journey to the Riverlands, while the mafia call theirs acqua al maestro - water to the master) appear to involve deep meditation, a long period in The Virtual, and a return with some level of enhancement that doesn't appear to involve normal cyber or bio grafts.

The White Vory is a American chapter of the larger Russian-based organization the Vory V Zakone. They have taken root in The Enclave only recently in the last decade. 

Recent weaknesses in the Cosa Nostra have created an opportunity for the Vory to both expand their protection business and put quite a few cops in their pockets.

It is believed that the alliances between the Vory and the EPD in the wake of these bribes has changed the power structure, moving from a smaller group led by a Vory (a criminal who climbed the ranks) to a Avtoritet (a government official of some sort who runs things from a distance)

Locally the Vory operated in a highly decentralized manner with a major leader passing instructions down through various cutouts and lutenents and the majority of the organization operating in independent cells, usually local to their particular region of The Enclave.
