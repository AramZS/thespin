brief: Amateur sleuth and Empowered human who stumbled into a Vory ritual.
---

Best buds and investigatory partners with Adel Martinez. 

Was doing a his own messy investigation of the Vory and their ritual to obtain power when he stepped right into a magic circle and got it for himself. He has since been stabalized and is currently in the Moonbase. 

Appears to have some basic Verdant powers now as an Empowered Human, telekinesis and mental force.

Has agreed to help investigate the names and backgrounds of coma patients in order to see if they connect to the etheric spirits found in the Moonbase Dataverse.
