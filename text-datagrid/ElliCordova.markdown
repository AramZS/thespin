A human who woke up in the moonbase after 10 years in cryo. She's stayed in the Moonbase. She keeps asking after Antim Quinn and looking for clues of her existence on the Moonbase. 

She now knows that The Mother of Daemons and Antim Quinn are one in the same. 

Quinn was her mentor and her boss, they had been working together to try and make the interactions between the Virtual and The Verdant safer and more stable. 

After talking with Eric Leahy and getting some of his records and code repositories she's now working on trying to understand what HC has done to the connection between our two worlds and what Antim was working on as an overall goal.
