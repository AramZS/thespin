This fine wood-paneled room is covered in elaborate magical signs and runes and filled to the brim with books, all digitized and searchable. There are few locations that could tell you more about the power of The Verdent. At the back is the reading alcove, a small podium with an isolated interface to AI334.

The AI 334 here is possessed by an aspect of YC/x named Gomory.
