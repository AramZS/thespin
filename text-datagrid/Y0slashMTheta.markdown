All things decay. YO slash MTheta, as he is called by the followers of the Theta Cult, is a being of unknown origins and limitations. He is far beyond our world, but the Theta Cultists wish him to come and bring the decay that will end all things. 

The Theta Cultists have realized that too much destabilization of the dimension will attract him and have him eat us all.
